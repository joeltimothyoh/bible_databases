[15:1] After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision, saying, `Fear not, Abram, I `am' a shield to thee, thy reward `is' exceeding great.'
[15:2] And Abram saith, `Lord Jehovah, what dost Thou give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.'
[15:3] And Abram saith, `Lo, to me Thou hast not given seed, and lo, a domestic doth heir me.'
[15:4] And lo, the word of Jehovah `is' unto him, saying, `This `one' doth not heir thee; but he who cometh out from thy bowels, he doth heir thee;'
[15:5] and He bringeth him out without, and saith, `Look attentively, I pray thee, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if thou art able to count them;' and He saith to him, `Thus is thy seed.'
[15:6] And he hath believed in Jehovah, and He reckoneth it to him -- righteousness.
[15:7] And He saith unto him, `I `am' Jehovah who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to thee this land to possess it;'
[15:8] and he saith, `Lord Jehovah, whereby do I know that I possess it?'
[15:9] And He saith unto him, `Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;'
[15:10] and he taketh to him all these, and separateth them in the midst, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he hath not divided;
[15:11] and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram causeth them to turn back.
[15:12] And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep hath fallen upon Abram, and lo, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;
[15:13] and He saith to Abram, `knowing -- know that thy seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,
[15:14] and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;
[15:15] and thou -- thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;
[15:16] and the fourth generation doth turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.'
[15:17] And it cometh to pass -- the sun hath gone in, and thick darkness hath been -- and lo, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which hath passed over between those pieces.
[15:18] In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant, saying, `To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,
[15:19] with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
[15:20] and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
[15:21] and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'

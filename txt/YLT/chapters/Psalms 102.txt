[102:1] A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble, and before Jehovah poureth out his plaint. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, yea, my cry to Thee cometh.
[102:2] Hide not Thou Thy face from me, In a day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call, haste, answer me.
[102:3] For consumed in smoke have been my days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.
[102:4] Smitten as the herb, and withered, is my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
[102:5] From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh.
[102:6] I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.
[102:7] I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the roof.
[102:8] All the day mine enemies reproached me, Those mad at me have sworn against me.
[102:9] Because ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping have mingled,
[102:10] From Thine indignation and Thy wrath, For Thou hast lifted me up, And dost cast me down.
[102:11] My days as a shadow `are' stretched out, And I -- as the herb I am withered.
[102:12] And Thou, O Jehovah, to the age abidest, And Thy memorial to all generations.
[102:13] Thou -- Thou risest -- Thou pitiest Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time hath come.
[102:14] For Thy servants have been pleased with her stones, And her dust they favour.
[102:15] And nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all kings of the earth Thine honour,
[102:16] For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He hath been seen in His honour,
[102:17] He turned unto the prayer of the destitute, And He hath not despised their prayer.
[102:18] This is written for a later generation, And the people created do praise Jah.
[102:19] For He hath looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked attentively,
[102:20] To hear the groan of the prisoner, To loose sons of death,
[102:21] To declare in Zion the name of Jehovah, And His praise in Jerusalem,
[102:22] In the peoples being gathered together, And the kingdoms -- to serve Jehovah.
[102:23] He hath humbled in the way my power, He hath shortened my days.
[102:24] I say, `My God, take me not up in the midst of my days,' Through all generations `are' Thine years.
[102:25] Beforetime the earth Thou didst found, And the work of Thy hands `are' the heavens.
[102:26] They -- They perish, and Thou remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing Thou changest them, And they are changed.
[102:27] And Thou `art' the same, and Thine years are not finished.
[102:28] The sons of Thy servants do continue, And their seed before Thee is established!

[59:1] To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not,' by David. -- A secret treasure, in Saul's sending, and they watch the house to put him to death. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God, From my withstanders set me on high.
[59:2] Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And from men of blood save me.
[59:3] For, lo, they laid wait for my soul, Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O Jehovah.
[59:4] Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see.
[59:5] And Thou, Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah.
[59:6] They turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And go round about the city.
[59:7] Lo, they belch out with their mouths, Swords `are' in their lips, for `Who heareth?'
[59:8] And Thou, O Jehovah dost laugh at them, Thou dost mock at all the nations.
[59:9] O my Strength, unto Thee I take heed, For God `is' my tower -- the God of my kindness.
[59:10] God doth go before me, He causeth me to look on mine enemies.
[59:11] Slay them not, lest my people forget, Shake them by Thy strength, And bring them down, O Lord our shield.
[59:12] The sin of their mouth `is' a word of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And from the curse and lying they recount.
[59:13] Consume in fury, consume and they are not, And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.
[59:14] And they turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And they go round about the city.
[59:15] They -- they wander for food, If they are not satisfied -- then they murmur.
[59:16] And I -- I sing `of' Thy strength, And I sing at morn `of' Thy kindness, For thou hast been a tower to me, And a refuge for me in a day of adversity.
[59:17] O my Strength, unto Thee I sing praise, For God `is' my tower, the God of my kindness!

[23:1] A Psalm of David. Jehovah `is' my shepherd, I do not lack,
[23:2] In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.
[23:3] My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,
[23:4] Also -- when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou `art' with me, Thy rod and Thy staff -- they comfort me.
[23:5] Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!
[23:6] Only -- goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling `is' in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!

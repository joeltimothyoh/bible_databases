[11:1] And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --
[11:2] Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?
[11:3] Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!
[11:4] And thou sayest, `Pure `is' my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.'
[11:5] And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.
[11:6] And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, `Some' of thine iniquity.
[11:7] By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?
[11:8] Heights of the heavens! -- what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! -- what knowest thou?
[11:9] Longer than earth `is' its measure, And broader than the sea.
[11:10] If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?
[11:11] For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider `it'!
[11:12] And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.
[11:13] If thou -- thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,
[11:14] If iniquity `is' in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents.
[11:15] For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.
[11:16] For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.
[11:17] And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest -- as the morning thou art.
[11:18] And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched -- in confidence thou liest down,
[11:19] And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;
[11:20] And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope `is' a breathing out of soul!

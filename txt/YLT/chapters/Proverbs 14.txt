[14:1] Every wise woman hath builded her house, And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.
[14:2] Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah, And the perverted `in' his ways is despising Him.
[14:3] In the mouth of a fool `is' a rod of pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them.
[14:4] Without oxen a stall `is' clean, And great `is' the increase by the power of the ox.
[14:5] A faithful witness lieth not, And a false witness breatheth out lies.
[14:6] A scorner hath sought wisdom, and it is not, And knowledge to the intelligent `is' easy.
[14:7] Go from before a foolish man, Or thou hast not known the lips of knowledge.
[14:8] The wisdom of the prudent `is' to understand his way, And the folly of fools `is' deceit.
[14:9] Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among the upright -- a pleasing thing.
[14:10] The heart knoweth its own bitterness, And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle.
[14:11] The house of the wicked is destroyed, And the tent of the upright flourisheth.
[14:12] There is a way -- right before a man, And its latter end `are' ways of death.
[14:13] Even in laughter is the heart pained, And the latter end of joy `is' affliction.
[14:14] From his ways is the backslider in heart filled, And a good man -- from his fruits.
[14:15] The simple giveth credence to everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.
[14:16] The wise is fearing and turning from evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.
[14:17] Whoso is short of temper doth folly, And a man of wicked devices is hated.
[14:18] The simple have inherited folly, And the prudent are crowned `with' knowledge.
[14:19] The evil have bowed down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
[14:20] Even of his neighbour is the poor hated, And those loving the rich `are' many.
[14:21] Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.
[14:22] Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth `are' to those devising good,
[14:23] In all labour there is advantage, And a thing of the lips `is' only to want.
[14:24] The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools `is' folly.
[14:25] A true witness is delivering souls, And a deceitful one breatheth out lies.
[14:26] In the fear of Jehovah `is' strong confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge.
[14:27] The fear of Jehovah `is' a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.
[14:28] In the multitude of a people `is' the honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince.
[14:29] Whoso is slow to anger `is' of great understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly.
[14:30] A healed heart `is' life to the flesh, And rottenness to the bones `is' envy.
[14:31] An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.
[14:32] In his wickedness is the wicked driven away, And trustful in his death `is' the righteous.
[14:33] In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known.
[14:34] Righteousness exalteth a nation, And the goodliness of peoples `is' a sin-offering.
[14:35] The favour of a king `is' to a wise servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!

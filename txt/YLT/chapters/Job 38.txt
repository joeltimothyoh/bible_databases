[38:1] And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: --
[38:2] Who `is' this -- darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?
[38:3] Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.
[38:4] Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding.
[38:5] Who placed its measures -- if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?
[38:6] On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?
[38:7] In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,
[38:8] And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out.
[38:9] In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,
[38:10] And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,
[38:11] And say, `Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.'
[38:12] Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?
[38:13] To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,
[38:14] It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.
[38:15] And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken.
[38:16] Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?
[38:17] Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?
[38:18] Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare -- if thou hast known it all.
[38:19] Where `is' this -- the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where `is' this -- its place?
[38:20] That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house.
[38:21] Thou hast known -- for then thou art born And the number of thy days `are' many!
[38:22] Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?
[38:23] That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle.
[38:24] Where `is' this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth.
[38:25] Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?
[38:26] To cause `it' to rain on a land -- no man, A wilderness -- no man in it.
[38:27] To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?
[38:28] Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
[38:29] From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?
[38:30] As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured.
[38:31] Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?
[38:32] Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?
[38:33] Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?
[38:34] Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?
[38:35] Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, `Behold us?'
[38:36] Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?
[38:37] Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,
[38:38] In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?
[38:39] Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?
[38:40] When they bow down in dens -- Abide in a thicket for a covert?
[38:41] Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food.

[103:1] By David. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And all my inward parts -- His Holy Name.
[103:2] Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget not all His benefits,
[103:3] Who is forgiving all thine iniquities, Who is healing all thy diseases,
[103:4] Who is redeeming from destruction thy life, Who is crowning thee -- kindness and mercies,
[103:5] Who is satisfying with good thy desire, Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.
[103:6] Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.
[103:7] He maketh known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.
[103:8] Merciful and gracious `is' Jehovah, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.
[103:9] Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch.
[103:10] Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.
[103:11] For, as the height of the heavens `is' above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing Him.
[103:12] As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.
[103:13] As a father hath mercy on sons, Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.
[103:14] For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we `are' dust.
[103:15] Mortal man! as grass `are' his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;
[103:16] For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.
[103:17] And the kindness of Jehovah `Is' from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons' sons,
[103:18] To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.
[103:19] Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.
[103:20] Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers, Mighty in power -- doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.
[103:21] Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His ministers -- doing His pleasure.
[103:22] Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!

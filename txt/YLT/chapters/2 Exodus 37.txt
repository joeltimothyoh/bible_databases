[37:1] And Bezaleel maketh the ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;
[37:2] and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;
[37:3] and he casteth for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;
[37:4] and he maketh staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold,
[37:5] and he bringeth in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
[37:6] And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;
[37:7] and he maketh two cherubs of gold, of beaten work he hath made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;
[37:8] one cherub at the end on this `side', and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he hath made the cherubs, at its two ends;
[37:9] and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces `are' one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been.
[37:10] And he maketh the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,
[37:11] and overlayeth it with pure gold, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about.
[37:12] And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and maketh a wreath of gold for its border round about;
[37:13] and he casteth for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which `are' to its four feet;
[37:14] over-against the border have the rings been, places for staves to bear the table.
[37:15] And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold, to bear the table;
[37:16] and he maketh the vessels which `are' upon the table, its dishes, and its bowls, and its cups, and the cups by which they pour out, of pure gold.
[37:17] And he maketh the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he hath made the candlestick, its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers, have been of the same;
[37:18] and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of its second side;
[37:19] three calyxes, made like almonds, in the one branch, a knop and a flower; and three calyxes, made like almonds, in another branch, a knop and a flower; so to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick.
[37:20] And in the candlestick `are' four calyxes, made like almonds, its knops, and its flowers,
[37:21] and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, `are' to the six branches which are coming out of it;
[37:22] their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.
[37:23] And he maketh its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold;
[37:24] of a talent of pure gold he hath made it, and all its vessels.
[37:25] And he maketh the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth (square), and two cubits its height; its horns have been of the same;
[37:26] and he overlayeth it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about, and its horns; and he maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;
[37:27] and two rings of gold he hath made for it under its wreath, at its two corners, at its two sides, for places for staves to bear it with them.
[37:28] And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold;
[37:29] and he maketh the holy anointing oil, and the pure spice-perfume -- work of a compounder.

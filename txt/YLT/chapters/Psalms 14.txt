[14:1] To the Overseer. -- By David. A fool hath said in his heart, `God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.
[14:2] Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one -- seeking God.
[14:3] The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.
[14:4] Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not called.
[14:5] There they have feared a fear, For God `is' in the generation of the righteous.
[14:6] The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink, Because Jehovah `is' his refuge.
[14:7] `Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back `To' a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!

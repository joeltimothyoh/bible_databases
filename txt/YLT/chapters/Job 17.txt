[17:1] My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished -- graves `are' for me.
[17:2] If not -- mockeries `are' with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.
[17:3] Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?
[17:4] For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them.
[17:5] For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed.
[17:6] And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am.
[17:7] And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them.
[17:8] Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up.
[17:9] And the righteous layeth hold `on' his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And -- dumb are they all.
[17:10] Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man.
[17:11] My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!
[17:12] Night for day they appoint, Light `is' near because of darkness.
[17:13] If I wait -- Sheol `is' my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch.
[17:14] To corruption I have called: -- `Thou `art' my father.' `My mother' and `my sister' -- to the worm.
[17:15] And where `is' now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?
[17:16] `To' the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest.

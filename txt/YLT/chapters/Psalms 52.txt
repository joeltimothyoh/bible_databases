[52:1] To the Overseer. -- An instruction, by David, in the coming in of Doeg the Edomite, and he declareth to Saul, and saith to him, `David came in unto the house of Ahimelech.' What, boasteth thou in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God `is' all the day.
[52:2] Mischiefs doth thy tongue devise, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
[52:3] Thou hast loved evil rather than good, Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.
[52:4] Thou hast loved all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
[52:5] Also -- God doth break thee down for ever, Taketh thee, and pulleth thee out of the tent, And He hath uprooted thee Out of the land of the living. Selah.
[52:6] And the righteous see, And fear, and laugh at him.
[52:7] `Lo, the man who maketh not God his strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong in his mischiefs.'
[52:8] And I, as a green olive in the house of God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,
[52:9] I thank Thee to the age, because Thou hast done `it', And I wait `on' Thy name for `it is' good before Thy saints!

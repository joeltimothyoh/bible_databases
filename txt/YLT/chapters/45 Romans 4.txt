[4:1] What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found, according to flesh?
[4:2] for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath to boast -- but not before god;
[4:3] for what doth the writing say? `And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;'
[4:4] and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt;
[4:5] and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned -- to righteousness:
[4:6] even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works:
[4:7] `Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins were covered;
[4:8] happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.'
[4:9] `Is' this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcision -- for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham -- to righteousness?
[4:10] how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;
[4:11] and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them,
[4:12] and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that `is' in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.
[4:13] For not through law `is' the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, of his being heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith;
[4:14] for if they who are of law `are' heirs, the faith hath been made void, and the promise hath been made useless;
[4:15] for the law doth work wrath; for where law is not, neither `is' transgression.
[4:16] Because of this `it is' of faith, that `it may be' according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that which `is' of the law only, but also to that which `is' of the faith of Abraham,
[4:17] who is father of us all (according as it hath been written -- `A father of many nations I have set thee,') before Him whom he did believe -- God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as being.
[4:18] Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: `So shall thy seed be;'
[4:19] and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah's womb,
[4:20] and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,
[4:21] and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised He is able also to do:
[4:22] wherefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness.
[4:23] And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him,
[4:24] but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned -- to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead,
[4:25] who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised up because of our being declared righteous.

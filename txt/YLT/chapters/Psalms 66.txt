[66:1] To the Overseer. -- A Song, a Psalm. Shout ye to God, all the earth.
[66:2] Praise ye the honour of His name, Make ye honourable His praise.
[66:3] Say to God, `How fearful `are' Thy works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee.
[66:4] All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.' Selah.
[66:5] Come ye, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men.
[66:6] He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.
[66:7] Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.
[66:8] Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,
[66:9] Who hath placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved.
[66:10] For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou hast refined us as the refining of silver.
[66:11] Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou hast placed pressure on our loins.
[66:12] Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out to a watered place.
[66:13] I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,
[66:14] For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:
[66:15] `Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.' Selah.
[66:16] Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul.
[66:17] Unto Him `with' my mouth I have called, And exaltation `is' under my tongue.
[66:18] Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord doth not hear.
[66:19] But God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
[66:20] Blessed `is' God, Who hath not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!

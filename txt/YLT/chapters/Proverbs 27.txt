[27:1] Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.
[27:2] Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.
[27:3] A stone `is' heavy, and the sand `is' heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.
[27:4] Fury `is' fierce, and anger `is' overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?
[27:5] Better `is' open reproof than hidden love.
[27:6] Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.
[27:7] A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And `to' a hungry soul every bitter thing `is' sweet.
[27:8] As a bird wandering from her nest, So `is' a man wandering from his place.
[27:9] Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one's friend -- from counsel of the soul.
[27:10] Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better `is' a near neighbour than a brother afar off.
[27:11] Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.
[27:12] The prudent hath seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.
[27:13] Take his garment, when a stranger hath been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.
[27:14] Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.
[27:15] A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,
[27:16] Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.
[27:17] Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.
[27:18] The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.
[27:19] As `in' water the face `is' to face, So the heart of man to man.
[27:20] Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.
[27:21] A refining pot `is' for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.
[27:22] If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things -- with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.
[27:23] Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,
[27:24] For riches `are' not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.
[27:25] Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.
[27:26] Lambs `are' for thy clothing, And the price of the field `are' he-goats,
[27:27] And a sufficiency of goats' milk `is' for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!

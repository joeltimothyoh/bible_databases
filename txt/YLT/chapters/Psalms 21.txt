[21:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Jehovah, in Thy strength is the king joyful, In Thy salvation how greatly he rejoiceth.
[21:2] The desire of his heart Thou gavest to him, And the request of his lips Thou hast not withheld. Selah.
[21:3] For Thou puttest before him blessings of goodness, Thou settest on his head a crown of fine gold.
[21:4] Life he hath asked from Thee, Thou hast given to him -- length of days, Age-during -- and for ever.
[21:5] Great `is' his honour in Thy salvation, Honour and majesty Thou placest on him.
[21:6] For Thou makest him blessings for ever, Thou dost cause him to rejoice with joy, By Thy countenance.
[21:7] For the king is trusting in Jehovah, And in the kindness of the Most High He is not moved.
[21:8] Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies, Thy right hand doth find Thy haters.
[21:9] Thou makest them as a furnace of fire, At the time of Thy presence. Jehovah in His anger doth swallow them, And fire doth devour them.
[21:10] Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest, And their seed from the sons of men.
[21:11] For they stretched out against Thee evil, They devised a wicked device, they prevail not,
[21:12] For Thou makest them a butt, When Thy strings Thou preparest against their faces.
[21:13] Be Thou exalted, O Jehovah in, Thy strength, We sing and we praise Thy might!

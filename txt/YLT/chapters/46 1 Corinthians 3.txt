[3:1] And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;
[3:2] with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able,
[3:3] for yet ye are fleshly, for where `there is' among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?
[3:4] for when one may say, `I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, `I -- of Apollos;' are ye not fleshly?
[3:5] Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?
[3:6] I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;
[3:7] so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;
[3:8] and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,
[3:9] for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building ye are.
[3:10] According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on `it',
[3:11] for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;
[3:12] and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --
[3:13] of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare `it', because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;
[3:14] if of any one the work doth remain that he built on `it', a wage he shall receive;
[3:15] if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.
[3:16] have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?
[3:17] if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.
[3:18] Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,
[3:19] for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, `Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'
[3:20] and again, `The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'
[3:21] So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,
[3:22] whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,
[3:23] and ye `are' Christ's, and Christ `is' God's.

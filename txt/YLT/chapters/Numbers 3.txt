[3:1] And these `are' births of Aaron and Moses, in the day of Jehovah's speaking with Moses in mount Sinai.
[3:2] And these `are' the names of the sons of Aaron: the first-born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar;
[3:3] these `are' the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whose hand he hath consecrated for acting as priest.
[3:4] And Nadab dieth -- Abihu also -- before Jehovah, in their bringing near strange fire before Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai, and sons they had not; and Eleazar -- Ithamar also -- acteth as priest in the presence of Aaron their father.
[3:5] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[3:6] `Bring near the tribe of Levi, and thou hast caused it to stand before Aaron the priest, and they have served him,
[3:7] and kept his charge, and the charge of all the company before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle;
[3:8] and they have kept all the vessels of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the sons of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle;
[3:9] and thou hast given the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are surely given to him out of the sons of Israel.
[3:10] `And Aaron and his sons thou dost appoint, and they have kept their priesthood, and the stranger who cometh near is put to death.'
[3:11] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[3:12] `And I, lo, I have taken the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel instead of every first-born opening a womb among the sons of Israel, and the Levites have been Mine;
[3:13] for Mine `is' every first-born, in the day of My smiting every first-born in the land of Egypt I have sanctified to Myself every first-born in Israel, from man unto beast; Mine they are; I `am' Jehovah.'
[3:14] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
[3:15] `Number the sons of Levi by the house of their fathers, by their families; every male from a son of a month and upward thou dost number them.'
[3:16] And Moses numbereth them according to the command of Jehovah, as he hath been commanded.
[3:17] And these are sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
[3:18] And these `are' the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
[3:19] And the sons of Kohath, by their families, `are' Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
[3:20] And the sons of Merari by their families `are' Mahli and Mushi; these are the families of the Levites, by the house of their fathers.
[3:21] Of Gershon `is' the family of the Libnite, and the family of the Shimite; these are the families of the Gershonite.
[3:22] Their numbered ones, in number, every male from a son of a month and upward, their numbered ones `are' seven thousand and five hundred.
[3:23] The families of the Gershonite, behind the tabernacle, do encamp westward.
[3:24] And the prince of a father's house for the Gershonite `is' Eliasaph son of Lael.
[3:25] And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting `is' the tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the vail at the opening of the tent of meeting,
[3:26] and the hangings of the court, and the vail at the opening of the court, which `is' by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and its cords, to all its service.
[3:27] And of Kohath `is' the family of the Amramite, and the family of the Izharite, and the family of the Hebronite, and the family of the Uzzielite; these are families of the Kohathite.
[3:28] In number, all the males, from a son of a month and upward, `are' eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
[3:29] The families of the sons of Kohath encamp by the side of the tabernacle southward.
[3:30] And the prince of a father's house for the families of the Kohathite `is' Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
[3:31] And their charge `is' the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary with which they serve, and the vail, and all its service.
[3:32] And `to' the prince of the princes of the Levites, Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, `is' the oversight of the keepers of the charge of the sanctuary.
[3:33] Of Merari `is' the family of the Mahlite, and the family of the Mushite; these `are' the families of Merari.
[3:34] And their numbered ones, in number, all the males from a son of a month and upward, `are' six thousand and two hundred.
[3:35] And the prince of a father's house for the families of Merari `is' Zuriel son of Abihail; by the side of the tabernacle they encamp northward.
[3:36] And the oversight -- the charge of the sons of Merari -- `is' the boards of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets, and all its vessels, and all its service,
[3:37] and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.
[3:38] And those encamping before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting, at the east, `are' Moses and Aaron, and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the sons of Israel, and the stranger who cometh near is put to death.
[3:39] All those numbered of the Levites whom Moses numbered -- Aaron also -- by the command of Jehovah, by their families, every male from a son of a month and upward, `are' two and twenty thousand.
[3:40] And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Number every first-born male of the sons of Israel from a son of a month and upward, and take up the number of their names;
[3:41] and thou hast taken the Levites for Me (I `am' Jehovah), instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of every firstling among the cattle of the sons of Israel.'
[3:42] And Moses numbereth, as Jehovah hath commanded him, all the first-born among the sons of Israel.
[3:43] And all the first-born -- male -- by the number of names, from a son of a month and upward, of their numbered ones, are two and twenty thousand two hundred and seventy and three.
[3:44] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[3:45] `Take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites have been Mine; I `am' Jehovah.
[3:46] `And `from' those ransomed of the two hundred and seventy and three (who are more than the Levites) of the first-born of the sons of Israel,
[3:47] thou hast even taken five shekels a-piece by the poll -- by the shekel of the sanctuary thou takest; twenty gerahs the shekel `is';
[3:48] and thou hast given the money to Aaron, and to his sons, whereby those over and above are ransomed.'
[3:49] And Moses taketh the ransom money from those over and above those ransomed by the Levites;
[3:50] from the first-born of the sons of Israel he hath taken the money, a thousand and three hundred and sixty and five -- by the shekel of the sanctuary;
[3:51] and Moses giveth the money of those ransomed to Aaron, and to his sons, according to the command of Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.

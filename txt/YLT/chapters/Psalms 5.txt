[5:1] To the Overseer, `Concerning the Inheritances.' -- A Psalm of David. My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.
[5:2] Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.
[5:3] Jehovah, `at' morning Thou hearest my voice, `At' morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out.
[5:4] For not a God desiring wickedness `art' Thou, Evil inhabiteth Thee not.
[5:5] The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity.
[5:6] Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and deceit Jehovah doth abominate.
[5:7] And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house, I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.
[5:8] O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,
[5:9] For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart `is' mischiefs, An open grave `is' their throat, Their tongue they make smooth.
[5:10] Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.
[5:11] And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing, and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy name exult in Thee.
[5:12] For Thou blessest the righteous, O Jehovah, As a buckler with favour dost compass him!

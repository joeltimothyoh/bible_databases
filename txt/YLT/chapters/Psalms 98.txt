[98:1] A Psalm. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and His holy arm.
[98:2] Jehovah hath made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,
[98:3] He hath remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God.
[98:4] Shout to Jehovah, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.
[98:5] Sing to Jehovah with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,
[98:6] With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout ye before the king Jehovah.
[98:7] Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
[98:8] Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,
[98:9] Before Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!

[148:1] Praise ye Jah! Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens, Praise ye Him in high places.
[148:2] Praise ye Him, all His messengers, Praise ye Him, all His hosts.
[148:3] Praise ye Him, sun and moon, Praise ye Him, all stars of light.
[148:4] Praise ye Him, heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.
[148:5] They do praise the name of Jehovah, For He commanded, and they were created.
[148:6] And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.
[148:7] Praise ye Jehovah from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,
[148:8] Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;
[148:9] The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,
[148:10] The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,
[148:11] Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,
[148:12] Young men, and also maidens, Aged men, with youths,
[148:13] They praise the name of Jehovah, For His name alone hath been set on high, His honour `is' above earth and heavens.
[148:14] And He exalteth the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints, Of the sons of Israel, a people near Him. Praise ye Jah!

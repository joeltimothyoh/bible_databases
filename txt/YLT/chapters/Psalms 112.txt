[112:1] Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah, In His commands he hath delighted greatly.
[112:2] Mighty in the earth is his seed, The generation of the upright is blessed.
[112:3] Wealth and riches `are' in his house, And his righteousness is standing for ever.
[112:4] Light hath risen in darkness to the upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
[112:5] Good `is' the man -- gracious and lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.
[112:6] For -- to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous.
[112:7] Of an evil report he is not afraid, Prepared is His heart, confident in Jehovah.
[112:8] Sustained is his heart -- he feareth not, Till that he look on his adversaries.
[112:9] He hath scattered -- hath given to the needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with honour.
[112:10] The wicked seeth, and hath been angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and hath melted, The desire of the wicked doth perish!

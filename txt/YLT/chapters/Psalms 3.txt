[3:1] A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.
[3:2] Many are saying of my soul, `There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah.
[3:3] And Thou, O Jehovah, `art' a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.
[3:4] My voice `is' unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.
[3:5] I -- I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.
[3:6] I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.
[3:7] Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies `on' the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken.
[3:8] Of Jehovah `is' this salvation; On Thy people `is' Thy blessing! Selah.

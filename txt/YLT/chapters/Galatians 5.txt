[5:1] In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free -- stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;
[5:2] lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;
[5:3] and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;
[5:4] ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away;
[5:5] for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,
[5:6] for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.
[5:7] Ye were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth?
[5:8] the obedience `is' not of him who is calling you!
[5:9] a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;
[5:10] I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.
[5:11] And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;
[5:12] O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!
[5:13] For ye -- to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another,
[5:14] for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'
[5:15] and if one another ye do bite and devour, see -- that ye may not by one another be consumed.
[5:16] And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete;
[5:17] for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will -- these ye may not do;
[5:18] and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.
[5:19] And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
[5:20] idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,
[5:21] envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.
[5:22] And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
[5:23] meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;
[5:24] and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;
[5:25] if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;
[5:26] let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking, one another envying!

[140:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from an evil man, From one of violence Thou keepest me.
[140:2] Who have devised evils in the heart, All the day they assemble `for' wars.
[140:3] They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, Poison of an adder `is' under their lips. Selah.
[140:4] Preserve me, Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked, From one of violence Thou keepest me, Who have devised to overthrow my steps.
[140:5] The proud hid a snare for me -- and cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set for me. Selah.
[140:6] I have said to Jehovah, `My God `art' Thou, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of my supplications.'
[140:7] O Jehovah, my Lord, strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of armour.
[140:8] Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.
[140:9] The chief of my surrounders, The perverseness of their lips covereth them.
[140:10] They cause to fall on themselves burning coals, Into fire He doth cast them, Into deep pits -- they arise not.
[140:11] A talkative man is not established in the earth, One of violence -- evil hunteth to overflowing.
[140:12] I have known that Jehovah doth execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.
[140:13] Only -- the righteous give thanks to Thy name, The upright do dwell with Thy presence!

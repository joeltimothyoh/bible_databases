[88:1] A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah, to the Overseer, `Concerning the Sickness of Afflictions.' -- An instruction, by Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I have cried, nightly before Thee,
[88:2] My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my loud cry,
[88:3] For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come to Sheol.
[88:4] I have been reckoned with those going down `to' the pit, I have been as a man without strength.
[88:5] Among the dead -- free, As pierced ones lying in the grave, Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand have been cut off.
[88:6] Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in depths.
[88:7] Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And `with' all Thy breakers Thou hast afflicted. Selah.
[88:8] Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up -- I go not forth.
[88:9] Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee, O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.
[88:10] To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.
[88:11] Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness in destruction?
[88:12] Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
[88:13] And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the morning doth my prayer come before Thee.
[88:14] Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy face from me.
[88:15] I `am' afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne Thy terrors -- I pine away.
[88:16] Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me off,
[88:17] They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have gone round against me together,
[88:18] Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine acquaintance `is' the place of darkness!

[7:1] For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,
[7:2] to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)
[7:3] without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.
[7:4] And see how great this one `is', to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,
[7:5] and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;
[7:6] and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,
[7:7] and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --
[7:8] and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there `he', who is testified to that he was living,
[7:9] and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,
[7:10] for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.
[7:11] If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?
[7:12] for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,
[7:13] for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,
[7:14] for `it is' evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
[7:15] And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,
[7:16] who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,
[7:17] for He doth testify -- `Thou `art' a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'
[7:18] for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,
[7:19] (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.
[7:20] And inasmuch as `it is' not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,
[7:21] and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou `art' a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')
[7:22] by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,
[7:23] and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;
[7:24] and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,
[7:25] whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them.
[7:26] For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,
[7:27] who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;
[7:28] for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that `is' after the law `appointeth' the Son -- to the age having been perfected.

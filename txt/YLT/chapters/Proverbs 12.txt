[12:1] Whoso is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof `is' brutish.
[12:2] The good bringeth forth favour from Jehovah, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.
[12:3] A man is not established by wickedness, And the root of the righteous is not moved.
[12:4] A virtuous woman `is' a crown to her husband, And as rottenness in his bones `is' one causing shame.
[12:5] The thoughts of the righteous `are' justice, The counsels of the wicked -- deceit.
[12:6] The words of the wicked `are': `Lay wait for blood,' And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.
[12:7] Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, And the house of the righteous standeth.
[12:8] According to his wisdom is a man praised, And the perverted of heart becometh despised.
[12:9] Better `is' the lightly esteemed who hath a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.
[12:10] The righteous knoweth the life of his beast, And the mercies of the wicked `are' cruel.
[12:11] Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied `with' bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking heart,
[12:12] The wicked hath desired the net of evil doers, And the root of the righteous giveth.
[12:13] In transgression of the lips `is' the snare of the wicked, And the righteous goeth out from distress.
[12:14] From the fruit of the mouth `is' one satisfied `with' good, And the deed of man's hands returneth to him.
[12:15] The way of a fool `is' right in his own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel `is' wise.
[12:16] The fool -- in a day is his anger known, And the prudent is covering shame.
[12:17] Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness, And a false witness -- deceit.
[12:18] A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.
[12:19] The lip of truth is established for ever, And for a moment -- a tongue of falsehood.
[12:20] Deceit `is' in the heart of those devising evil, And to those counselling peace `is' joy.
[12:21] No iniquity is desired by the righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.
[12:22] An abomination to Jehovah `are' lying lips, And stedfast doers `are' his delight.
[12:23] A prudent man is concealing knowledge, And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.
[12:24] The hand of the diligent ruleth, And slothfulness becometh tributary.
[12:25] Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down, And a good word maketh him glad.
[12:26] The righteous searcheth his companion, And the way of the wicked causeth them to err.
[12:27] The slothful roasteth not his hunting, And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.
[12:28] In the path of righteousness `is' life, And in the way of `that' path `is' no death!

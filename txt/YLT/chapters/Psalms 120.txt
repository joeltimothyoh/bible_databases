[120:1] A Song of the Ascents. Unto Jehovah in my distress I have called, And He answereth me.
[120:2] O Jehovah, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!
[120:3] What doth He give to thee? And what doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!
[120:4] Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals.
[120:5] Wo to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.
[120:6] Too much hath my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.
[120:7] I `am' peace, and when I speak they `are' for war!

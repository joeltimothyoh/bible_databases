[31:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. In Thee, O Jehovah, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age, In Thy righteousness deliver me.
[31:2] Incline unto me Thine ear hastily, deliver me, Be to me for a strong rock, For a house of bulwarks to save me.
[31:3] For my rock and my bulwark `art' Thou, For Thy name's sake lead me and tend me.
[31:4] Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, For Thou `art' my strength.
[31:5] Into Thy hand I commit my spirit, Thou hast redeemed me, Jehovah God of truth.
[31:6] I have hated the observers of lying vanities, And I toward Jehovah have been confident.
[31:7] I rejoice, and am glad in Thy kindness, In that Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast known in adversities my soul.
[31:8] And Thou hast not shut me up, Into the hand of an enemy, Thou hast caused my feet to stand in a broad place.
[31:9] Favour me, O Jehovah, for distress `is' to me, Mine eye, my soul, and my body Have become old by provocation.
[31:10] For my life hath been consumed in sorrow And my years in sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity hath been my strength, And my bones have become old.
[31:11] Among all mine adversaries I have been a reproach, And to my neighbours exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintances, Those seeing me without -- fled from me.
[31:12] I have been forgotten as dead out of mind, I have been as a perishing vessel.
[31:13] For I have heard an evil account of many, Fear `is' round about. In their being united against me, To take my life they have devised,
[31:14] And I on Thee -- I have trusted, O Jehovah, I have said, `Thou `art' my God.'
[31:15] In Thy hand `are' my times, Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from my pursuers.
[31:16] Cause Thy face to shine on Thy servant, Save me in Thy kindness.
[31:17] O Jehovah, let me not be ashamed, For I have called Thee, let the wicked be ashamed, Let them become silent to Sheol.
[31:18] Let lips of falsehood become dumb, That are speaking against the righteous, Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.
[31:19] How abundant is Thy goodness, That Thou hast laid up for those fearing Thee,
[31:20] Thou hast wrought for those trusting in Thee, Before sons of men. Thou hidest them in the secret place of Thy presence, From artifices of man, Thou concealest them in a tabernacle, From the strife of tongues.
[31:21] Blessed `is' Jehovah, For He hath made marvellous His kindness To me in a city of bulwarks.
[31:22] And I -- I have said in my haste, `I have been cut off from before Thine eyes,' But Thou hast heard the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee.
[31:23] Love Jehovah, all ye His saints, Jehovah is keeping the faithful, And recompensing abundantly a proud doer.
[31:24] Be strong, and He strengtheneth your heart, All ye who are waiting for Jehovah!

[18:3] And David smiteth Hadarezer king of Zobah, at Hamath, in his going to establish his power by the river Phrat,

[18:7] And David taketh the shields of gold that have been on the servants of Hadarezer, and bringeth them in to Jerusalem;

[18:10] and he sendeth Hadoram his son unto king David, to ask of him of peace, and to bless him (because that he hath fought against Hadarezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars with Tou had Hadarezer been,) and all kinds of vessels, of gold, and silver, and brass;
[18:11] also them hath king David sanctified to Jehovah with the silver and the gold that he hath taken from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

[18:14] And David reigneth over all Israel, and he is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people,
[18:15] and Joab son of Zeruiah `is' over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud `is' remembrancer,
[18:16] and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Abimelech son of Abiathar, `are' priests, and Shavsha `is' scribe,
[18:17] and Benaiah son of Jehoiada `is' over the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the elder sons of David `are' at the hand of the king.

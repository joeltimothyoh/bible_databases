[83:1] A Song, -- A Psalm of Asaph. O God, let there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God.
[83:2] For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have lifted up the head,
[83:3] Against Thy people they take crafty counsel, And consult against Thy hidden ones.
[83:4] They have said, `Come, And we cut them off from `being' a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.'
[83:5] For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a covenant they make,
[83:6] Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,
[83:7] Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre,
[83:8] Asshur also is joined with them, They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.
[83:9] Do to them as `to' Midian, As `to' Sisera, as `to' Jabin, at the stream Kishon.
[83:10] They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the ground!
[83:11] Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes,
[83:12] Who have said, `Let us occupy for ourselves The comely places of God.'
[83:13] O my God, make them as a rolling thing, As stubble before wind.
[83:14] As a fire doth burn a forest, And as a flame setteth hills on fire,
[83:15] So dost Thou pursue them with Thy whirlwind, And with Thy hurricane troublest them.
[83:16] Fill their faces `with' shame, And they seek Thy name, O Jehovah.
[83:17] They are ashamed and troubled for ever, Yea, they are confounded and lost.
[83:18] And they know that Thou -- (Thy name `is' Jehovah -- by Thyself,) `Art' the Most High over all the earth!

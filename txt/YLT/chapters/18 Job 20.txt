[20:1] And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --
[20:2] Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my sensations in me.
[20:3] The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine understanding Doth cause me to answer:
[20:4] This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?
[20:5] That the singing of the wicked `is' short, And the joy of the profane for a moment,
[20:6] Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head against a cloud he strike --
[20:7] As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say: `Where `is' he?'
[20:8] As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is driven away as a vision of the night,
[20:9] The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again doth his place behold him.
[20:10] His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his wealth.
[20:11] His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the dust it lieth down.
[20:12] Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it under his tongue,
[20:13] Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back in the midst of his palate,
[20:14] His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps `is' in his heart.
[20:15] Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his belly God driveth it out.
[20:16] Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a viper.
[20:17] He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter.
[20:18] He is giving back `what' he laboured for, And doth not consume `it'; As a bulwark `is' his exchange, and he exults not.
[20:19] For he oppressed -- he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it.
[20:20] For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself.
[20:21] There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good doth not stay.
[20:22] In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him.
[20:23] It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth on him in his eating.
[20:24] He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow of brass.
[20:25] One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him `are' terrors.
[20:26] All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.
[20:27] Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising itself against him.
[20:28] Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a day of His anger.
[20:29] This `is' the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God.

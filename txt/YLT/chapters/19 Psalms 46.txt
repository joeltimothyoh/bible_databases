[46:1] To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. `For the Virgins.' -- A song. God `is' to us a refuge and strength, A help in adversities found most surely.
[46:2] Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth, And in the slipping of mountains Into the heart of the seas.
[46:3] Roar -- troubled are its waters, Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.
[46:4] A river -- its rivulets rejoice the city of God, Thy holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
[46:5] God `is' in her midst -- she is not moved, God doth help her at the turn of the morn!
[46:6] Troubled have been nations, Moved have been kingdoms, He hath given forth with His voice, earth melteth.
[46:7] Jehovah of Hosts `is' with us, A tower for us `is' the God of Jacob. Selah.
[46:8] Come ye, see the works of Jehovah, Who hath done astonishing things in the earth,
[46:9] Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He hath cut asunder, Chariots he doth burn with fire.
[46:10] Desist, and know that I `am' God, I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth.
[46:11] Jehovah of hosts `is' with us, A tower for us `is' the God of Jacob! Selah.

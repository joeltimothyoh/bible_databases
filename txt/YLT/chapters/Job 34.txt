[34:1] And Elihu answereth and saith:
[34:2] Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me.
[34:3] For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.
[34:4] Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what `is' good.
[34:5] For Job hath said, `I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,
[34:6] Against my right do I lie? Mortal `is' mine arrow -- without transgression.'
[34:7] Who `is' a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,
[34:8] And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness.
[34:9] For he hath said, `It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.'
[34:10] Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And `from' the Mighty to do perverseness:
[34:11] For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find.
[34:12] Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment.
[34:13] Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?
[34:14] If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth.
[34:15] Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.
[34:16] And if `there is' understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words.
[34:17] Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?
[34:18] Who hath said to a king -- `Worthless,' Unto princes -- `Wicked?'
[34:19] That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands `are' all of them.
[34:20] `In' a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.
[34:21] For His eyes `are' on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see.
[34:22] There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;
[34:23] For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,
[34:24] He breaketh the mighty -- no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.
[34:25] Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised.
[34:26] As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders.
[34:27] Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,
[34:28] To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth.
[34:29] And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, `It is' the same.
[34:30] From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;
[34:31] For unto God hath any said: `I have taken away, I do not corruptly,
[34:32] Besides `that which' I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done -- I do not add?'
[34:33] By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused -- That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.
[34:34] Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me.
[34:35] Job -- not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words `are' not with wisdom.
[34:36] My Father! let Job be tried -- unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,
[34:37] For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.

[99:1] Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.
[99:2] Jehovah in Zion `is' great, And high He `is' over all the peoples.
[99:3] They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy `it' is.'
[99:4] And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou -- Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou -- Thou hast done.
[99:5] Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy `is' He.
[99:6] Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.
[99:7] In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.
[99:8] O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.
[99:9] Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy `is' Jehovah our God!

[1:1] In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,
[1:2] in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;
[1:3] who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,
[1:4] having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.
[1:5] For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou art -- I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, `I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'
[1:6] and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;'
[1:7] and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'
[1:8] and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, `is' to the age of the age; a scepter of righteousness `is' the scepter of thy reign;
[1:9] thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil of gladness above thy partners;'
[1:10] and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;
[1:11] these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,
[1:12] and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.'
[1:13] And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?'
[1:14] are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?

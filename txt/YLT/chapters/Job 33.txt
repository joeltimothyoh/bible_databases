[33:1] And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and `to' all my words give ear.
[33:2] Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate.
[33:3] Of the uprightness of my heart `are' my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken.
[33:4] The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me.
[33:5] If thou art able -- answer me, Set in array before me -- station thyself.
[33:6] Lo, I `am', according to thy word, for God, From the clay I -- I also, have been formed.
[33:7] Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy.
[33:8] Surely -- thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:
[33:9] `Pure `am' I, without transgression, Innocent `am' I, and I have no iniquity.
[33:10] Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,
[33:11] He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.'
[33:12] Lo, `in' this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man.
[33:13] Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When `for' all His matters He answereth not?
[33:14] For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)
[33:15] In a dream -- a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.
[33:16] Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:
[33:17] To turn aside man `from' doing, And pride from man He concealeth.
[33:18] He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart.
[33:19] And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones `is' enduring.
[33:20] And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food.
[33:21] His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!
[33:22] And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death.
[33:23] If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter -- one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:
[33:24] Then He doth favour him and saith, `Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.'
[33:25] Fresher `is' his flesh than a child's, He returneth to the days of his youth.
[33:26] He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness.
[33:27] He looketh on men, and saith, `I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.
[33:28] He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.'
[33:29] Lo, all these doth God work, Twice -- thrice with man,
[33:30] To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living.
[33:31] Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I -- I do speak.
[33:32] If there are words -- answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee.
[33:33] If there are not -- hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom.

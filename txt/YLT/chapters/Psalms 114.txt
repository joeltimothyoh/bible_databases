[114:1] In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,
[114:2] Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
[114:3] The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.
[114:4] The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.
[114:5] What -- to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!
[114:6] O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!
[114:7] From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,
[114:8] He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!

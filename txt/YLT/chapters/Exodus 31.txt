[31:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[31:2] `See, I have called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
[31:3] and I fill him `with' the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,
[31:4] to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
[31:5] and in graving of stone for settings, and in graving of wood to work in all work.
[31:6] `And I, lo, I have given with him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of every wise-hearted one I have given wisdom, and they have made all that which I have commanded thee.
[31:7] `The tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy-seat which `is' on it, and all the vessels of the tent,
[31:8] and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick and all its vessels, and the altar of the perfume,
[31:9] and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base,
[31:10] and the coloured garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for acting as priests in;
[31:11] and the anointing oil, and the perfume of the spices for the sanctuary; according to all that I have commanded thee -- they do.'
[31:12] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[31:13] `And thou, speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Only, My sabbaths ye do keep, for it `is' a sign between Me and you, to your generations, to know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you;
[31:14] and ye have kept the sabbath, for it `is' holy to you, he who is polluting it is certainly put to death -- for any who doeth work in it -- that person hath even been cut off from the midst of his people.
[31:15] `Six days is work done, and in the seventh day `is' a sabbath of holy rest to Jehovah; any who doeth work in the sabbath-day is certainly put to death,
[31:16] and the sons of Israel have observed the sabbath; to keep the sabbath to their generations `is' a covenant age-during,
[31:17] between Me and the sons of Israel it `is' a sign -- to the age; for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day He hath ceased, and is refreshed.'
[31:18] And He giveth unto Moses, when He finisheth speaking with him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written by the finger of God.

[24:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[24:2] `Command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure olive oil, beaten, for the lamp, to cause a light to go up continually;
[24:3] at the outside of the vail of the testimony in the tent of meeting doth Aaron arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah continually -- a statute age-during to your generations;
[24:4] by the pure candlestick he doth arrange the lights before Jehovah continually.
[24:5] `And thou hast taken flour, and hast baked twelve cakes with it, two tenth deals are in the one cake,
[24:6] and thou hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Jehovah,
[24:7] and thou hast put on the rank pure frankincense, and it hath been to the bread for a memorial, a fire-offering to Jehovah.
[24:8] `On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel -- a covenant age-during;
[24:9] and it hath been to Aaron, and to his sons, and they have eaten it in the holy place, for it `is' most holy to him, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah -- a statute age-during.'
[24:10] And a son of an Israelitish woman goeth out (and he `is' son of an Egyptian man), in the midst of the sons of Israel, and strive in the camp do the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel,
[24:11] and the son of the Israelitish woman execrateth the Name, and revileth; and they bring him in unto Moses; and his mother's name `is' Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;
[24:12] and he causeth him to rest in charge -- to explain to them by the mouth of Jehovah.
[24:13] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[24:14] `Bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp; and all those hearing have laid their hands on his head, and all the company have stoned him.
[24:15] `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, When any man revileth his God -- then he hath borne his sin;
[24:16] and he who is execrating the name of Jehovah is certainly put to death; all the company do certainly cast stones at him; as a sojourner so a native, in his execrating the Name, is put to death.
[24:17] `And when a man smiteth any soul of man, he is certainly put to death.
[24:18] `And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, body for body.
[24:19] `And when a man putteth a blemish in his fellow, as he hath done so it is done to him;
[24:20] breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he putteth a blemish in a man so it is done in him.
[24:21] `And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, and he who smiteth `the life of' man is put to death;
[24:22] one judgment is to you; as a sojourner so is a native; for I `am' Jehovah your God.'
[24:23] And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and they bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the sons of Israel have done as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.

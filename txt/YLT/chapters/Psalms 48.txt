[48:1] A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah. Great `is' Jehovah, and praised greatly, In the city of our God -- His holy hill.
[48:2] Beautiful `for' elevation, A joy of all the land, `is' Mount Zion, The sides of the north, the city of a great king.
[48:3] God in her high places is known for a tower.
[48:4] For, lo, the kings met, they passed by together,
[48:5] They have seen -- so they have marvelled, They have been troubled, they were hastened away.
[48:6] Trembling hath seized them there, Pain, as of a travailing woman.
[48:7] By an east wind Thou shiverest ships of Tarshish.
[48:8] As we have heard, so we have seen, In the city of Jehovah of hosts, In the city of our God, God doth establish her -- to the age. Selah.
[48:9] We have thought, O God, of Thy kindness, In the midst of Thy temple,
[48:10] As `is' Thy name, O God, so `is' Thy praise, Over the ends of the earth, Righteousness hath filled Thy right hand.
[48:11] Rejoice doth Mount Zion, The daughters of Judah are joyful, For the sake of Thy judgments.
[48:12] Compass Zion, and go round her, count her towers,
[48:13] Set your heart to her bulwark, Consider her high places, So that ye recount to a later generation,
[48:14] That this God `is' our God -- To the age and for ever, He -- he doth lead us over death!

[118:5] From the straitness I called Jah, Jah answered me in a broad place.
[118:6] Jehovah `is' for me, I do not fear what man doth to me.
[118:7] Jehovah `is' for me among my helpers, And I -- I look on those hating me.
[118:8] Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man,
[118:9] Better to take refuge in Jehovah, Than to trust in princes.
[118:10] All nations have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.
[118:11] They have compassed me about, Yea, they have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.
[118:12] They compassed me about as bees, They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.
[118:13] Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall, And Jehovah hath helped me.
[118:14] My strength and song `is' Jah, And He is to me for salvation.
[118:15] A voice of singing and salvation, `Is' in the tents of the righteous, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.
[118:16] The right hand of Jehovah is exalted, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.
[118:17] I do not die, but live, And recount the works of Jah,
[118:18] Jah hath sorely chastened me, And to death hath not given me up.

[118:20] This `is' the gate to Jehovah, The righteous enter into it.
[118:21] I thank Thee, for Thou hast answered me, And art to me for salvation.
[118:22] A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner.
[118:23] From Jehovah hath this been, It `is' wonderful in our eyes,

[118:26] Blessed `is' he who is coming In the name of Jehovah, We blessed you from the house of Jehovah,

[118:28] My God Thou `art', and I confess Thee, My God, I exalt Thee.
[118:29] Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, `is' His kindness!

[26:1] As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour `is' not comely for a fool.
[26:2] As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, So reviling without cause doth not come.
[26:3] A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an ass, And a rod for the back of fools.
[26:4] Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou be like to him -- even thou.
[26:5] Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
[26:6] He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.
[26:7] Weak have been the two legs of the lame, And a parable in the mouth of fools.
[26:8] As one who is binding a stone in a sling, So `is' he who is giving honour to a fool.
[26:9] A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.
[26:10] Great `is' the Former of all, And He is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.
[26:11] As a dog hath returned to its vomit, A fool is repeating his folly.
[26:12] Thou hast seen a man wise in his own eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!
[26:13] The slothful hath said, `A lion `is' in the way, A lion `is' in the broad places.'
[26:14] The door turneth round on its hinge, And the slothful on his bed.
[26:15] The slothful hath hid his hand in a dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.
[26:16] Wiser `is' the slothful in his own eyes, Than seven `men' returning a reason.
[26:17] Laying hold on the ears of a dog, `Is' a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.
[26:18] As `one' pretending to be feeble, Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,
[26:19] So hath a man deceived his neighbour, And hath said, `Am not I playing?'
[26:20] Without wood is fire going out, And without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,
[26:21] Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.
[26:22] The words of a tale-bearer `are' as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down `to' the inner parts of the heart.
[26:23] Silver of dross spread over potsherd, `Are' burning lips and an evil heart.
[26:24] By his lips doth a hater dissemble, And in his heart he placeth deceit,
[26:25] When his voice is gracious trust not in him, For seven abominations `are' in his heart.
[26:26] Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed is its wickedness in an assembly.
[26:27] Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.
[26:28] A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!

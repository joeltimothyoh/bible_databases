[32:1] And these three men cease from answering Job, for he `is' righteous in his own eyes,
[32:2] and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;
[32:3] and against his three friends hath his anger burned, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.
[32:4] And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days.
[32:5] And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth.
[32:6] And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith: -- Young I `am' in days, and ye `are' age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.
[32:7] I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.
[32:8] Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand.
[32:9] The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment.
[32:10] Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion -- even I.
[32:11] Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings.
[32:12] And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, `Or' answerer of his sayings among you.
[32:13] Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man.
[32:14] And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him.
[32:15] (They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words.
[32:16] And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)
[32:17] I answer, even I -- my share, I shew my opinion -- even I.
[32:18] For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,
[32:19] Lo, my breast `is' as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up.
[32:20] I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer.
[32:21] Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,
[32:22] For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away.

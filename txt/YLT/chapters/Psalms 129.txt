[129:1] A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:
[129:2] Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.
[129:3] Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.
[129:4] Jehovah `is' righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.
[129:5] Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.
[129:6] They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,
[129:7] That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.
[129:8] And the passers by have not said, `The blessing of Jehovah `is' on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!'

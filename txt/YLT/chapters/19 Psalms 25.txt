[25:1] By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, my soul I lift up.
[25:2] My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.
[25:3] Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed, Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.
[25:4] Thy ways, O Jehovah, cause me to know, Thy paths teach Thou me.
[25:5] Cause me to tread in Thy truth, and teach me, For Thou `art' the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited all the day.
[25:6] Remember Thy mercies, O Jehovah, And Thy kindnesses, for from the age `are' they.
[25:7] Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, Do not Thou remember. According to Thy kindness be mindful of me, For Thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.
[25:8] Good and upright `is' Jehovah, Therefore He directeth sinners in the way.
[25:9] He causeth the humble to tread in judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.
[25:10] All the paths of Jehovah `are' kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies.
[25:11] For Thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Thou hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it `is' great.
[25:12] Who `is' this -- the man fearing Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose.
[25:13] His soul in good doth remain, And his seed doth possess the land.
[25:14] The secret of Jehovah `is' for those fearing Him, And His covenant -- to cause them to know.
[25:15] Mine eyes `are' continually unto Jehovah, For He bringeth out from a net my feet.
[25:16] Turn Thou unto me, and favour me, For lonely and afflicted `am' I.
[25:17] The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.
[25:18] See mine affliction and my misery, And bear with all my sins.
[25:19] See my enemies, for they have been many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.
[25:20] Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.
[25:21] Integrity and uprightness do keep me, For I have waited `on' Thee.
[25:22] Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!

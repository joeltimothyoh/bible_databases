[4:1] And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --
[4:2] Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?
[4:3] Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong.
[4:4] The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen.
[4:5] But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.
[4:6] Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the perfection of thy ways?
[4:7] Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?
[4:8] As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!
[4:9] From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed.
[4:10] The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken.
[4:11] An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate.
[4:12] And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it.
[4:13] In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,
[4:14] Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear.
[4:15] And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;
[4:16] It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude `is' over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:
[4:17] `Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?
[4:18] Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.'
[4:19] Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation `is' in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)
[4:20] From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish.
[4:21] Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!

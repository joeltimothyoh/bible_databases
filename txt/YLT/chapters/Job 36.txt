[36:1] And Elihu addeth and saith: --
[36:2] Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God `are' words.
[36:3] I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness.
[36:4] For, truly, my words `are' not false, The perfect in knowledge `is' with thee.
[36:5] Lo, God `is' mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty `in' power `and' heart.
[36:6] He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;
[36:7] He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And `from' kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high,
[36:8] And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,
[36:9] Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,
[36:10] And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity.
[36:11] If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness.
[36:12] And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge.
[36:13] And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them.
[36:14] Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled.
[36:15] He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear.
[36:16] And also He moved thee from a strait place, `To' a broad place -- no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness.
[36:17] And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld -- because of fury,
[36:18] Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside.
[36:19] Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power.
[36:20] Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead.
[36:21] Take heed -- do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than `on' affliction.
[36:22] Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who `is' like Him -- a teacher?
[36:23] Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, `Thou hast done iniquity?'
[36:24] Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.
[36:25] All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar.
[36:26] Lo, God `is' high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there `is' no searching.
[36:27] When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,
[36:28] Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly.
[36:29] Yea, doth `any' understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle?
[36:30] Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,
[36:31] For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance.
[36:32] By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,
[36:33] He sheweth by it `to' his friend substance, Anger against perversity.

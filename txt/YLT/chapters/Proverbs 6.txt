[6:1] My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,
[6:2] Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,
[6:3] Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,
[6:4] Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,
[6:5] Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.
[6:6] Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;
[6:7] Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,
[6:8] She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.
[6:9] Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?
[6:10] A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,
[6:11] And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.
[6:12] A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking `with' perverseness of mouth,
[6:13] Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,
[6:14] Frowardness `is' in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.
[6:15] Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken -- and no healing.
[6:16] These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven `are' abominations to His soul.
[6:17] Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands shedding innocent blood --
[6:18] A heart devising thoughts of vanity -- Feet hasting to run to evil --
[6:19] A false witness `who' doth breathe out lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren.
[6:20] Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.
[6:21] Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.
[6:22] In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked -- it talketh `with' thee.
[6:23] For a lamp `is' the command, And the law a light, And a way of life `are' reproofs of instruction,
[6:24] To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
[6:25] Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.
[6:26] For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.
[6:27] Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?
[6:28] Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?
[6:29] So `is' he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.
[6:30] They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,
[6:31] And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.
[6:32] He who committeth adultery `with' a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.
[6:33] A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,
[6:34] For jealousy `is' the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.
[6:35] He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!

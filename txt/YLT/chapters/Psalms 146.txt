[146:1] Praise ye Jah! Praise, O my soul, Jehovah.
[146:2] I praise Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.
[146:3] Trust not in princes -- in a son of man, For he hath no deliverance.
[146:4] His spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, In that day have his thoughts perished.
[146:5] O the happiness of him Who hath the God of Jacob for his help, His hope `is' on Jehovah his God,
[146:6] Making the heavens and earth, The sea and all that `is' in them, Who is keeping truth to the age,
[146:7] Doing judgment for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry.
[146:8] Jehovah is loosing the prisoners, Jehovah is opening (the eyes of) the blind, Jehovah is raising the bowed down, Jehovah is loving the righteous,
[146:9] Jehovah is preserving the strangers, The fatherless and widow He causeth to stand, And the way of the wicked He turneth upside down.
[146:10] Jehovah doth reign to the age, Thy God, O Zion, to generation and generation, Praise ye Jah!

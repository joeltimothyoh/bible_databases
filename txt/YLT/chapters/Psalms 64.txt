[64:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, From the fear of an enemy Thou keepest my life,
[64:2] Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the tumult of workers of iniquity.
[64:3] Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their arrow -- a bitter word.
[64:4] To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot him, and fear not.
[64:5] They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount of the hiding of snares, They have said, `Who doth look at it?'
[64:6] They search out perverse things, `We perfected a searching search,' And the inward part of man, and the heart `are' deep.
[64:7] And God doth shoot them `with' an arrow, Sudden have been their wounds,
[64:8] And they cause him to stumble, Against them `is' their own tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.
[64:9] And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed they have considered wisely.
[64:10] The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah, And hath trusted in Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of heart!

[108:1] A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.
[108:2] Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.
[108:3] I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.
[108:4] For great above the heavens `is' Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.
[108:5] Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.
[108:6] That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save `with' Thy right hand, and answer us.
[108:7] God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
[108:8] Mine `is' Gilead, mine `is' Manasseh, And Ephraim `is' the strength of my head, Judah `is' my lawgiver,
[108:9] Moab `is' a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.
[108:10] Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
[108:11] Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!
[108:12] Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.
[108:13] In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!

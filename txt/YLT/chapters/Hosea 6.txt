[6:1] `Come, and we turn back unto Jehovah, For He hath torn, and He doth heal us, He doth smite, and He bindeth us up.
[6:2] He doth revive us after two days, In the third day He doth raise us up, And we live before Him.
[6:3] And we know -- we pursue to know Jehovah, As the dawn prepared is His going forth, And He cometh in as a shower to us, As gathered rain -- sprinkling earth.'
[6:4] What do I do to thee, O Ephraim? What do I do to thee, O Judah? Your goodness `is' as a cloud of the morning, And as dew rising early -- going.
[6:5] Therefore I have hewed by prophets, I have slain them by sayings of My mouth, And My judgments to the light goeth forth.
[6:6] For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, And a knowledge of God above burnt-offerings.
[6:7] And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, There they dealt treacherously against me.
[6:8] Gilead `is' a city of workers of iniquity, Slippery from blood.
[6:9] And as bands do wait for a man, A company of priests do murder -- the way to Shechem, For wickedness they have done.
[6:10] In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, There `is' the whoredom of Ephraim -- defiled is Israel.
[6:11] Also, O Judah, appointed is a harvest to thee, In My turning back `to' the captivity of My people!

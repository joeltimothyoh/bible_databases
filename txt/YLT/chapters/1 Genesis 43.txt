[43:1] And the famine `is' severe in the land;
[43:2] and it cometh to pass, when they have finished eating the corn which they brought from Egypt, that their father saith unto them, `Turn back, buy for us a little food.'
[43:3] And Judah speaketh unto him, saying, `The man protesting protested to us, saying, Ye do not see my face without your brother `being' with you;
[43:4] if thou art sending our brother with us, we go down, and buy for thee food,
[43:5] and if thou art not sending -- we do not go down, for the man said unto us, Ye do not see my face without your brother `being' with you.'
[43:6] And Israel saith, `Why did ye evil to me, by declaring to the man that ye had yet a brother?'
[43:7] and they say, `The man asked diligently concerning us, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? and we declare to him according to the tenor of these things; do we certainly know that he will say, Bring down your brother?'
[43:8] And Judah saith unto Israel his father, `Send the youth with me, and we arise, and go, and live, and do not die, both we, and thou, and our infants.
[43:9] I -- I am surety `for' him, from my hand thou dost require him; if I have not brought him in unto thee, and set him before thee -- then I have sinned against thee all the days;
[43:10] for if we had not lingered, surely now we had returned these two times.'
[43:11] And Israel their father saith unto them, `If so, now, this do: take of the praised thing of the land in your vessels, and take down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds;
[43:12] and double money take in your hand, even the money which is brought back in the mouth of your bags, ye take back in your hand, it may be it `is' an oversight.
[43:13] `And take your brother, and rise, turn back unto the man;
[43:14] and God Almighty give to you mercies before the man, so that he hath sent to you your other brother and Benjamin; and I, when I am bereaved -- I am bereaved.'
[43:15] And the men take this present, double money also they have taken in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rise, and go down to Egypt, and stand before Joseph;
[43:16] and Joseph seeth Benjamin with them, and saith to him who `is' over his house, `Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and make ready, for with me do the men eat at noon.'
[43:17] And the man doth as Joseph hath said, and the man bringeth in the men into the house of Joseph,
[43:18] and the men are afraid because they have been brought into the house of Joseph, and they say, `For the matter of the money which was put back in our bags at the commencement are we brought in -- to roll himself upon us, and to throw himself on us, and to take us for servants -- our asses also.'
[43:19] And they come nigh unto the man who `is' over the house of Joseph, and speak unto him at the opening of the house,
[43:20] and say, `O, my lord, we really come down at the commencement to buy food;
[43:21] and it cometh to pass, when we have come in unto the lodging-place, and open our bags, that lo, each one's money `is' in the mouth of his bag, our money in its weight, and we bring it back in our hand;
[43:22] and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we have not known who put our money in our bags.'
[43:23] And he saith, `Peace to you, fear not: your God and the God of your father hath given to you hidden treasure in your bags, your money came unto me;' and he bringeth out Simeon unto them.
[43:24] And the man bringeth in the men into Joseph's house, and giveth water, and they wash their feet; and he giveth provender for their asses,
[43:25] and they prepare the present until the coming of Joseph at noon, for they have heard that there they do eat bread.
[43:26] And Joseph cometh into the house, and they bring to him the present which `is' in their hand, into the house, and bow themselves to him, to the earth;
[43:27] and he asketh of them of peace, and saith, `Is your father well? the aged man of whom ye have spoken, is he yet alive?'
[43:28] and they say, `Thy servant our father `is' well, he is yet alive;' and they bow, and do obeisance.
[43:29] And he lifteth up his eyes, and seeth Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and saith, `Is this your young brother, of whom ye have spoken unto me?' and he saith, `God favour thee, my son.'
[43:30] And Joseph hasteth, for his bowels have been moved for his brother, and he seeketh to weep, and entereth the inner chamber, and weepeth there;
[43:31] and he washeth his face, and goeth out, and refraineth himself, and saith, `Place bread.'
[43:32] And they place for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who are eating with him by themselves: for the Egyptians are unable to eat bread with the Hebrews, for it `is' an abomination to the Egyptians.
[43:33] And they sit before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the young one according to his youth, and the men wonder one at another;
[43:34] and he lifteth up gifts from before him unto them, and the gift of Benjamin is five hands more than the gifts of all of them; and they drink, yea, they drink abundantly with him.

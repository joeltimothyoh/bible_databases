[28:1] The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.
[28:2] By the transgression of a land many `are' its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right -- it is prolonged.
[28:3] A man -- poor and oppressing the weak, `Is' a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.
[28:4] Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.
[28:5] Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.
[28:6] Better `is' the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.
[28:7] Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.
[28:8] Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.
[28:9] Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer `is' an abomination.
[28:10] Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.
[28:11] A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.
[28:12] In the exulting of the righteous the glory `is' abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.
[28:13] Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.
[28:14] O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.
[28:15] A growling lion, and a ranging bear, `Is' the wicked ruler over a poor people.
[28:16] A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.
[28:17] A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.
[28:18] Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.
[28:19] Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied `with' bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled `with' poverty.
[28:20] A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.
[28:21] To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.
[28:22] Troubled for wealth `is' the man `with' an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.
[28:23] Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.
[28:24] Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, `It is not transgression,' A companion he is to a destroyer.
[28:25] Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.
[28:26] Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.
[28:27] Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.
[28:28] In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!

[74:1] An Instruction of Asaph. Why, O God, hast Thou cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Thy pasture.
[74:2] Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase of old, Thou didst redeem the rod of Thy inheritance, This mount Zion -- Thou didst dwell in it.
[74:3] Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.
[74:4] Roared have thine adversaries, In the midst of Thy meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.
[74:5] He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood -- axes.
[74:6] And now, its carvings together With axe and hatchet they break down,
[74:7] They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary, to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Thy name,
[74:8] They said in their hearts, `Let us oppress them together,' They did burn all the meeting-places of God in the land.
[74:9] Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.
[74:10] Till when, O God, doth an adversary reproach? Doth an enemy despise thy name for ever?
[74:11] Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand, Even Thy right hand? From the midst of Thy bosom remove `it'.
[74:12] And God `is' my king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
[74:13] Thou hast broken by Thy strength a sea-`monster', Thou hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters,
[74:14] Thou hast broken the heads of leviathan, Thou makest him food, For the people of the dry places.
[74:15] Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a stream, Thou hast dried up perennial flowings.
[74:16] Thine `is' the day, also Thine `is' the night, Thou hast prepared a light giver -- the sun.
[74:17] Thou hast set up all the borders of earth, Summer and winter Thou hast formed them.
[74:18] Remember this -- an enemy reproached Jehovah, And a foolish people have despised Thy name.
[74:19] Give not up to a company, The soul of Thy turtle-dove, The company of Thy poor ones forget not for ever.
[74:20] Look attentively to the covenant, For the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.
[74:21] Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Thy name,
[74:22] Arise, O God, plead Thy plea, Remember Thy reproach from a fool all the day.
[74:23] Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The noise of Thy withstanders is going up continually!

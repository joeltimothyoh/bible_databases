[147:1] Praise ye Jah! For `it is' good to praise our God, For pleasant -- comely `is' praise.
[147:2] Building Jerusalem `is' Jehovah, The driven away of Israel He gathereth.
[147:3] Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, And is binding up their griefs.
[147:4] Appointing the number of the stars, To all them He giveth names.
[147:5] Great `is' our Lord, and abundant in power, Of His understanding there is no narration.
[147:6] Jehovah is causing the meek to stand, Making low the wicked unto the earth.
[147:7] Answer ye to Jehovah with thanksgiving, Sing ye to our God with a harp.
[147:8] Who is covering the heavens with clouds, Who is preparing for the earth rain, Who is causing grass to spring up `on' mountains,
[147:9] Giving to the beast its food, To the young of the ravens that call.
[147:10] Not in the might of the horse doth He delight, Not in the legs of a man is He pleased.
[147:11] Jehovah is pleased with those fearing Him, With those waiting for His kindness.
[147:12] Glorify, O Jerusalem, Jehovah, Praise thy God, O Zion.
[147:13] For He did strengthen the bars of thy gates, He hath blessed thy sons in thy midst.
[147:14] Who is making thy border peace, `With' the fat of wheat He satisfieth Thee.
[147:15] Who is sending forth His saying `on' earth, Very speedily doth His word run.
[147:16] Who is giving snow like wool, Hoar-frost as ashes He scattereth.
[147:17] Casting forth His ice like morsels, Before His cold who doth stand?
[147:18] He sendeth forth His word and melteth them, He causeth His wind to blow -- the waters flow.
[147:19] Declaring His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
[147:20] He hath not done so to any nation, As to judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye Jah!

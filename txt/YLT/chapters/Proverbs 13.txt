[13:1] A wise son -- the instruction of a father, And a scorner -- he hath not heard rebuke.
[13:2] From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous -- violence.
[13:3] Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips -- ruin to him!
[13:4] The soul of the slothful is desiring, and hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.
[13:5] A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.
[13:6] Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.
[13:7] There is who is making himself rich, and hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth `is' abundant.
[13:8] The ransom of a man's life `are' his riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke.
[13:9] The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.
[13:10] A vain man through pride causeth debate, And with the counselled `is' wisdom.
[13:11] Wealth from vanity becometh little, And whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.
[13:12] Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life `is' the coming desire.
[13:13] Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.
[13:14] The law of the wise `is' a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.
[13:15] Good understanding giveth grace, And the way of the treacherous `is' hard.
[13:16] Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.
[13:17] A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.
[13:18] Whoso is refusing instruction -- poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.
[13:19] A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools `is': Turn from evil.
[13:20] Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.
[13:21] Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.
[13:22] A good man causeth sons' sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous `is' the sinner's wealth.
[13:23] Abundance of food -- the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.
[13:24] Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.
[13:25] The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!

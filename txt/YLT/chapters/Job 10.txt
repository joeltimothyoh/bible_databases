[10:1] My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul.
[10:2] I say unto God, `Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive `with' me.
[10:3] Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?
[10:4] Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth -- seest Thou?
[10:5] As the days of man `are' Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?
[10:6] That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?
[10:7] For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand.
[10:8] Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!
[10:9] Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back.
[10:10] Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?
[10:11] Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and sinews dost fence me.
[10:12] Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit.
[10:13] And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known that this `is' with Thee.
[10:14] If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine iniquity dost not acquit me,
[10:15] If I have done wickedly -- wo to me, And righteously -- I lift not up my head, Full of shame -- then see my affliction,
[10:16] And it riseth -- as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back -- Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.
[10:17] Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare `are' with me.
[10:18] And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me.
[10:19] As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,
[10:20] Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,
[10:21] Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,
[10:22] A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade -- and no order, And the shining `is' as thick darkness.'

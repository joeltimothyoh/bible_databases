[18:1] And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
[18:2] When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.
[18:3] Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!
[18:4] (He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?
[18:5] Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.
[18:6] The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.
[18:7] Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.
[18:8] For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.
[18:9] Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.
[18:10] Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.
[18:11] Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him -- at his feet.
[18:12] Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.
[18:13] It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death's first-born.
[18:14] Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.
[18:15] It dwelleth in his tent -- out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.
[18:16] From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.
[18:17] His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.
[18:18] They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.
[18:19] He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.
[18:20] At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.
[18:21] Only these `are' tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.

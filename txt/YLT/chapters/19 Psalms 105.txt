[105:1] Give ye thanks to Jehovah -- call ye in His name, Make known among the peoples His acts.
[105:2] Sing ye to Him -- sing praise to Him, Meditate ye on all His wonders.
[105:3] Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The heart of those seeking Jehovah rejoiceth.
[105:4] Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek ye His face continually.
[105:5] Remember His wonders that He did, His signs and the judgments of His mouth.
[105:6] O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
[105:7] He `is' Jehovah our God, In all the earth `are' His judgments.
[105:8] He hath remembered to the age His covenant, The word He commanded to a thousand generations,
[105:9] That He hath made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,
[105:10] And doth establish it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel -- a covenant age-during,
[105:11] Saying, `To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,'
[105:12] In their being few in number, But a few, and sojourners in it.
[105:13] And they go up and down, from nation unto nation, From a kingdom unto another people.
[105:14] He hath not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth for their sakes kings.
[105:15] `Strike not against Mine anointed, And to My prophets do not evil.'
[105:16] And He calleth a famine on the land, The whole staff of bread He hath broken.
[105:17] He hath sent before them a man, For a servant hath Joseph been sold.
[105:18] They have afflicted with fetters his feet, Iron hath entered his soul,
[105:19] Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of Jehovah hath tried him.
[105:20] The king hath sent, and looseth him, The ruler of the peoples, and draweth him out.
[105:21] He hath made him lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions.
[105:22] To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And his elders he maketh wise.
[105:23] And Israel cometh in to Egypt, And Jacob hath sojourned in the land of Ham.
[105:24] And He maketh His people very fruitful, And maketh it mightier than its adversaries.
[105:25] He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.
[105:26] He hath sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had fixed on.
[105:27] They have set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.
[105:28] He hath sent darkness, and it is dark, And they have not provoked His word.
[105:29] He hath turned their waters to blood, And putteth to death their fish.
[105:30] Teemed hath their land `with' frogs, In the inner chambers of their kings.
[105:31] He hath said, and the beetle cometh, Lice into all their border.
[105:32] He hath made their showers hail, A flaming fire `is' in their land.
[105:33] And He smiteth their vine and their fig, And shivereth the trees of their border.
[105:34] He hath said, and the locust cometh, And the cankerworm -- innumerable,
[105:35] And it consumeth every herb in their land, And it consumeth the fruit of their ground.
[105:36] And He smiteth every first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,
[105:37] And bringeth them out with silver and gold, And there is not in its tribes a feeble one.
[105:38] Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going forth, For their fear had fallen upon them.
[105:39] He hath spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to enlighten the night.
[105:40] They have asked, and He bringeth quails, And `with' bread of heaven satisfieth them.
[105:41] He hath opened a rock, and waters issue, They have gone on in dry places -- a river.
[105:42] For He hath remembered His holy word, With Abraham His servant,
[105:43] And He bringeth forth His people with joy, With singing His chosen ones.
[105:44] And He giveth to them the lands of nations, And the labour of peoples they possess,
[105:45] That they may observe His statutes, And His laws may keep. Praise ye Jehovah!

[47:1] To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,
[47:2] For Jehovah Most High `is' fearful, A great king over all the earth.
[47:3] He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
[47:4] He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.
[47:5] God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
[47:6] Praise God -- praise -- give praise to our king, praise.
[47:7] For king of all the earth `is' God, Give praise, O understanding one.
[47:8] God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,
[47:9] Nobles of peoples have been gathered, `With' the people of the God of Abraham, For to God `are' the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!

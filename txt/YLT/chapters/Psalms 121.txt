[121:1] A Song of the Ascents. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?
[121:2] My help `is' from Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,
[121:3] He suffereth not thy foot to be moved, Thy preserver slumbereth not.
[121:4] Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.
[121:5] Jehovah `is' thy preserver, Jehovah `is' thy shade on thy right hand,
[121:6] By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor the moon by night.
[121:7] Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil, He doth preserve thy soul.
[121:8] Jehovah preserveth thy going out and thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!

[7:1] Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?
[7:2] As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,
[7:3] So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me.
[7:4] If I lay down then I said, `When do I rise!' And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.
[7:5] Clothed hath been my flesh `with' worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,
[7:6] My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope.
[7:7] Remember Thou that my life `is' a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good.
[7:8] The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes `are' upon me -- and I am not.
[7:9] Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up.
[7:10] He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again.
[7:11] Also I -- I withhold not my mouth -- I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.
[7:12] A sea-`monster' am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?
[7:13] When I said, `My bed doth comfort me,' He taketh away in my talking my couch.
[7:14] And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,
[7:15] And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones.
[7:16] I have wasted away -- not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days `are' vanity.
[7:17] What `is' man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?
[7:18] And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?
[7:19] How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.
[7:20] I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself -- and what?
[7:21] Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me -- and I am not!

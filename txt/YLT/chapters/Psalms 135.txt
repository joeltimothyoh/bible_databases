[135:1] Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,
[135:2] Who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.
[135:3] Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah `is' good, Sing praise to His name, for `it is' pleasant.
[135:4] For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.
[135:5] For I have known that great `is' Jehovah, Yea, our Lord `is' above all gods.
[135:6] All that Jehovah pleased He hath done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,
[135:7] Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.
[135:8] Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.
[135:9] He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.
[135:10] Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,
[135:11] Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.
[135:12] And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,
[135:13] O Jehovah, Thy name `is' to the age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations.
[135:14] For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.
[135:15] The idols of the nations `are' silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.
[135:16] A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
[135:17] Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose -- there is no breath in their mouth!
[135:18] Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
[135:19] O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah, O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,
[135:20] O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah, Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
[135:21] Blessed `is' Jehovah from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem -- praise ye Jah!

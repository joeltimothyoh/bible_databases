[122:1] A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, `To the house of Jehovah we go.'
[122:2] Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!
[122:3] Jerusalem -- the builded one -- `Is' as a city that is joined to itself together.
[122:4] For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
[122:5] For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.
[122:6] Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee.
[122:7] Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,
[122:8] For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, `Peace `be' in thee.'
[122:9] For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, I seek good for thee!

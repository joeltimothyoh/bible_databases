[11:1] Followers of me become ye, as I also `am' of Christ.
[11:2] And I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances ye keep,
[11:3] and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of Christ is God.
[11:4] Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered, doth dishonour his head,
[11:5] and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven,
[11:6] for if a woman is not covered -- then let her be shorn, and if `it is' a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven -- let her be covered;
[11:7] for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man,
[11:8] for a man is not of a woman, but a woman `is' of a man,
[11:9] for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a woman because of the man;
[11:10] because of this the woman ought to have `a token of' authority upon the head, because of the messengers;
[11:11] but neither `is' a man apart from a woman, nor a woman apart from a man, in the Lord,
[11:12] for as the woman `is' of the man, so also the man `is' through the woman, and the all things `are' of God.
[11:13] In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God?
[11:14] doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him?
[11:15] and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her, because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her;
[11:16] and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the assemblies of God.
[11:17] And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the better, but for the worse ye come together;
[11:18] for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe `it',
[11:19] for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those approved may become manifest among you;
[11:20] ye, then, coming together at the same place -- it is not to eat the Lord's supper;
[11:21] for each his own supper doth take before in the eating, and one is hungry, and another is drunk;
[11:22] why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!
[11:23] For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,
[11:24] and having given thanks, he brake, and said, `Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do ye -- to the remembrance of me.'
[11:25] In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying, `This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye may drink `it' -- to the remembrance of me;'
[11:26] for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth -- till he may come;
[11:27] so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord:
[11:28] and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink;
[11:29] for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself he doth eat and drink -- not discerning the body of the Lord.
[11:30] Because of this, among you many `are' weak and sickly, and sleep do many;
[11:31] for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged,
[11:32] and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned;
[11:33] so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait ye;
[11:34] and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange.

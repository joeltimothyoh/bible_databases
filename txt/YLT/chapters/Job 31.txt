[31:1] A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what -- do I attend to a virgin?
[31:2] And what `is' the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?
[31:3] Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?
[31:4] Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?
[31:5] If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to deceit,
[31:6] He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know my integrity.
[31:7] If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,
[31:8] Let me sow -- and another eat, And my products let be rooted out.
[31:9] If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening of my neighbour I laid wait,
[31:10] Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others bend.
[31:11] For it `is' a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity;
[31:12] For a fire it `is', to destruction it consumeth, And among all mine increase doth take root,
[31:13] If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my handmaid, In their contending with me,
[31:14] Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect, What do I answer Him?
[31:15] Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare us in the womb doth One.
[31:16] If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the widow do consume,
[31:17] And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not eat of it,
[31:18] (But from my youth He grew up with me as `with' a father, And from the belly of my mother I am led.)
[31:19] If I see `any' perishing without clothing, And there is no covering to the needy,
[31:20] If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of my sheep He doth not warm himself,
[31:21] If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in `him' the gate of my court,
[31:22] My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the bone be broken.
[31:23] For a dread unto me `is' calamity `from' God, And because of His excellency I am not able.
[31:24] If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold have said, `My trust,'
[31:25] If I rejoice because great `is' my wealth, And because abundance hath my hand found,
[31:26] If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon walking,
[31:27] And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss my mouth,
[31:28] It also `is' a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God above.
[31:29] If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up myself when evil found him,
[31:30] Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an oath his life.
[31:31] If not -- say ye, O men of my tent, `O that we had of his flesh, we are not satisfied.'
[31:32] In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the traveller I open.
[31:33] If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my bosom mine iniquity,
[31:34] Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of the opening.
[31:35] Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written.
[31:36] If not -- on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown on myself.
[31:37] The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach Him.
[31:38] If against me my land doth cry out, And together its furrows weep,
[31:39] If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,
[31:40] Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished.

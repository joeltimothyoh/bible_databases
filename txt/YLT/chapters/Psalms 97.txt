[97:1] Jehovah hath reigned, The earth is joyful, many isles rejoice.
[97:2] Cloud and darkness `are' round about Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.
[97:3] Fire before Him goeth, And burneth round about His adversaries.
[97:4] Lightened have His lightnings the world, The earth hath seen, and is pained.
[97:5] Hills, like wax, melted before Jehovah, Before the Lord of all the earth.
[97:6] The heavens declared His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His honour.
[97:7] Ashamed are all servants of a graven image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods.
[97:8] Zion hath heard and rejoiceth, And daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Thy judgments, O Jehovah.
[97:9] For Thou, Jehovah, `art' Most High over all the earth, Greatly Thou hast been exalted over all gods.
[97:10] Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil, He is keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he delivereth them.
[97:11] Light `is' sown for the righteous, And for the upright of heart -- joy.
[97:12] Rejoice, ye righteous, in Jehovah, And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!

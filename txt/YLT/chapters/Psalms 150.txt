[150:1] Praise ye Jah! Praise ye God in His holy place, Praise Him in the expanse of His strength.
[150:2] Praise Him in His mighty acts, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness.
[150:3] Praise Him with blowing of trumpet, Praise Him with psaltery and harp.
[150:4] Praise Him with timbrel and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and organ.
[150:5] Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, Praise Him with cymbals of shouting.
[150:6] All that doth breathe doth praise Jah! Praise ye Jah!

[138:1] By David. I confess Thee, with all my heart, Before the gods I do praise Thee.
[138:2] I bow myself toward Thy holy temple, And I confess Thy name, For Thy kindness, and for Thy truth, For Thou hast made great Thy saying above all Thy name.
[138:3] In the day I called, when Thou dost answer me, Thou dost strengthen me in my soul `with' strength.
[138:4] O Jehovah, all kings of earth confess Thee, When they have heard the sayings of Thy mouth.
[138:5] And they sing in the ways of Jehovah, For great `is' the honour of Jehovah.
[138:6] For high `is' Jehovah, and the lowly He seeth, And the haughty from afar He knoweth.
[138:7] If I walk in the midst of distress Thou quickenest me, Against the anger of mine enemies Thou sendest forth Thy hand, And Thy right hand doth save me.
[138:8] Jehovah doth perfect for me, O Jehovah, Thy kindness `is' to the age, The works of Thy hands let not fall!

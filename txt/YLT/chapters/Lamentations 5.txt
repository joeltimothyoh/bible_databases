[5:1] Remember, O Jehovah, what hath befallen us, Look attentively, and see our reproach.
[5:2] Our inheritance hath been turned to strangers, Our houses to foreigners.
[5:3] Orphans we have been -- without a father, our mothers `are' as widows.
[5:4] Our water for money we have drunk, Our wood for a price doth come.
[5:5] For our neck we have been pursued, We have laboured -- there hath been no rest for us.
[5:6] `To' Egypt we have given a hand, `To' Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.
[5:7] Our fathers have sinned -- they are not, We their iniquities have borne.
[5:8] Servants have ruled over us, A deliverer there is none from their hand.
[5:9] With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
[5:10] Our skin as an oven hath been burning, Because of the raging of the famine.
[5:11] Wives in Zion they have humbled, Virgins -- in cities of Judah.
[5:12] Princes by their hand have been hanged, The faces of elders have not been honoured.
[5:13] Young men to grind they have taken, And youths with wood have stumbled.
[5:14] The aged from the gate have ceased, Young men from their song.
[5:15] Ceased hath the joy of our heart, Turned to mourning hath been our dancing.
[5:16] Fallen hath the crown `from' our head, Wo `is' now to us, for we have sinned.
[5:17] For this hath our heart been sick, For these have our eyes been dim.
[5:18] For the mount of Zion -- that is desolate, Foxes have gone up on it.
[5:19] Thou, O Jehovah, to the age remainest, Thy throne to generation and generation.
[5:20] Why for ever dost Thou forget us? Thou forsakest us for length of days!
[5:21] Turn us back, O Jehovah, unto Thee, And we turn back, renew our days as of old.
[5:22] For hast Thou utterly rejected us? Thou hast been wroth against us -- exceedingly?

[5:1] My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,
[5:2] To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.
[5:3] For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil `is' her mouth,
[5:4] And her latter end `is' bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword `with' mouths.
[5:5] Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.
[5:6] The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths -- thou knowest not.
[5:7] And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.
[5:8] Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,
[5:9] Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,
[5:10] Lest strangers be filled `with' thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,
[5:11] And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,
[5:12] And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,
[5:13] And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.
[5:14] As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.
[5:15] Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.
[5:16] Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.
[5:17] Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.
[5:18] Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,
[5:19] A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.
[5:20] And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?
[5:21] For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.
[5:22] His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.
[5:23] He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!

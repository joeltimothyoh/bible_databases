[34:1] By David, in his changing his behaviour before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he goeth. I do bless Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise `is' in my mouth.
[34:2] In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.
[34:3] Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me, And we exalt His name together.
[34:4] I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.
[34:5] They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.
[34:6] This poor `one' called, and Jehovah heard, And from all his distresses saved him.
[34:7] A messenger of Jehovah is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.
[34:8] Taste ye and see that Jehovah `is' good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.
[34:9] Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.
[34:10] Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,
[34:11] Come ye, children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I do teach you.
[34:12] Who `is' the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?
[34:13] Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.
[34:14] Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.
[34:15] The eyes of Jehovah `are' unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.
[34:16] (The face of Jehovah `is' on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)
[34:17] They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.
[34:18] Near `is' Jehovah to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.
[34:19] Many `are' the evils of the righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him.
[34:20] He is keeping all his bones, One of them hath not been broken.
[34:21] Evil doth put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.
[34:22] Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!

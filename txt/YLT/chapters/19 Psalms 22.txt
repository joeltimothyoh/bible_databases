[22:1] To the Overseer, on `The Hind of the Morning.' -- A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation, The words of my roaring?
[22:2] My God, I call by day, and Thou answerest not, And by night, and there is no silence to me.
[22:3] And Thou `art' holy, Sitting -- the Praise of Israel.
[22:4] In Thee did our fathers trust -- they trusted, And Thou dost deliver them.
[22:5] Unto Thee they cried, and were delivered, In Thee they trusted, and were not ashamed.
[22:6] And I `am' a worm, and no man, A reproach of man, and despised of the people.
[22:7] All beholding me do mock at me, They make free with the lip -- shake the head,
[22:8] `Roll unto Jehovah, He doth deliver him, He doth deliver him, for he delighted in him.'
[22:9] For thou `art' He bringing me forth from the womb, Causing me to trust, On the breasts of my mother.
[22:10] On Thee I have been cast from the womb, From the belly of my mother Thou `art' my God.
[22:11] Be not far from me, For adversity is near, for there is no helper.
[22:12] Many bulls have surrounded me, Mighty ones of Bashan have compassed me,
[22:13] They have opened against me their mouth, A lion tearing and roaring.
[22:14] As waters I have been poured out, And separated themselves have all my bones, My heart hath been like wax, It is melted in the midst of my bowels.
[22:15] Dried up as an earthen vessel is my power, And my tongue is cleaving to my jaws.
[22:16] And to the dust of death thou appointest me, For surrounded me have dogs, A company of evil doers have compassed me, Piercing my hands and my feet.
[22:17] I count all my bones -- they look expectingly, They look upon me,
[22:18] They apportion my garments to themselves, And for my clothing they cause a lot to fall.
[22:19] And Thou, O Jehovah, be not far off, O my strength, to help me haste.
[22:20] Deliver from the sword my soul, From the paw of a dog mine only one.
[22:21] Save me from the mouth of a lion: -- And -- from the horns of the high places Thou hast answered me!
[22:22] I declare Thy name to my brethren, In the midst of the assembly I praise Thee.
[22:23] Ye who fear Jehovah, praise ye Him, All the seed of Jacob, honour ye Him, And be afraid of Him, all ye seed of Israel.
[22:24] For He hath not despised, nor abominated, The affliction of the afflicted, Nor hath He hidden His face from him, And in his crying unto Him He heareth.
[22:25] Of Thee my praise `is' in the great assembly. My vows I complete before His fearers.
[22:26] The humble do eat and are satisfied, Praise Jehovah do those seeking Him, Your heart doth live for ever.
[22:27] Remember and return unto Jehovah, Do all ends of the earth, And before Thee bow themselves, Do all families of the nations,
[22:28] For to Jehovah `is' the kingdom, And He is ruling among nations.
[22:29] And the fat ones of earth have eaten, And they bow themselves, Before Him bow do all going down to dust, And he `who' hath not revived his soul.
[22:30] A seed doth serve Him, It is declared of the Lord to the generation.
[22:31] They come and declare His righteousness, To a people that is borne, that He hath made!

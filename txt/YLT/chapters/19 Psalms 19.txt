[19:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. The heavens `are' recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse `is' declaring.
[19:2] Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.
[19:3] There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice hath not been heard.
[19:4] Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,
[19:5] And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.
[19:6] From the end of the heavens `is' his going out, And his revolution `is' unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat.
[19:7] The law of Jehovah `is' perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah `are' stedfast, Making wise the simple,
[19:8] The precepts of Jehovah `are' upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah `is' pure, enlightening the eyes,
[19:9] The fear of Jehovah `is' clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah `are' true, They have been righteous -- together.
[19:10] They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.
[19:11] Also -- Thy servant is warned by them, `In keeping them `is' a great reward.'
[19:12] Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,
[19:13] Also -- from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,
[19:14] Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer!

[9:1] To the Overseer, `On the Death of Labben.' -- A Psalm of David. I confess, O Jehovah, with all my heart, I recount all Thy wonders,
[9:2] I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy Name, O Most High.
[9:3] In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish from Thy face.
[9:4] For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness.
[9:5] Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever.
[9:6] O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial with them.
[9:7] And Jehovah to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment His throne.
[9:8] And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.
[9:9] And Jehovah is a tower for the bruised, A tower for times of adversity.
[9:10] They trust in Thee who do know Thy name, For Thou hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Jehovah.
[9:11] Sing ye praise to Jehovah, inhabiting Zion, Declare ye among the peoples His acts,
[9:12] For He who is seeking for blood Them hath remembered, He hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.
[9:13] Favour me, O Jehovah, See mine affliction by those hating me, Thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,
[9:14] So that I recount all Thy praise, In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Thy salvation.
[9:15] Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In a net that they hid hath their foot been captured.
[9:16] Jehovah hath been known, Judgment He hath done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation. Selah.
[9:17] The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All nations forgetting God.
[9:18] For not for ever is the needy forgotten, The hope of the humble lost to the age.
[9:19] Rise, O Jehovah, let not man be strong, Let nations be judged before Thy face.
[9:20] Appoint, O Jehovah, a director to them, Let nations know they `are' men! Selah.

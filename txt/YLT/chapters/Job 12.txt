[12:1] And Job answereth and saith: --
[12:2] Truly -- ye `are' the people, And with you doth wisdom die.
[12:3] I also have a heart like you, I am not fallen more than you, And with whom is there not like these?
[12:4] A laughter to his friend I am: `He calleth to God, and He answereth him,' A laughter `is' the perfect righteous one.
[12:5] A torch -- despised in the thoughts of the secure Is prepared for those sliding with the feet.
[12:6] At peace are the tents of spoilers, And those provoking God have confidence, He into whose hand God hath brought.
[12:7] And yet, ask, I pray thee, `One of' the beasts, and it doth shew thee, And a fowl of the heavens, And it doth declare to thee.
[12:8] Or talk to the earth, and it sheweth thee, And fishes of the sea recount to thee:
[12:9] `Who hath not known in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this?
[12:10] In whose hand `is' the breath of every living thing, And the spirit of all flesh of man.'
[12:11] Doth not the ear try words? And the palate taste food for itself?
[12:12] With the very aged `is' wisdom, And `with' length of days understanding.
[12:13] With Him `are' wisdom and might, To him `are' counsel and understanding.
[12:14] Lo, He breaketh down, and it is not built up, He shutteth against a man, And it is not opened.
[12:15] Lo, He keepeth in the waters, and they are dried up, And he sendeth them forth, And they overturn the land.
[12:16] With Him `are' strength and wisdom, His the deceived and deceiver.
[12:17] Causing counsellors to go away a spoil, And judges He maketh foolish.
[12:18] The bands of kings He hath opened, And He bindeth a girdle on their loins.
[12:19] Causing ministers to go away a spoil And strong ones He overthroweth.
[12:20] Turning aside the lip of the stedfast, And the reason of the aged He taketh away.
[12:21] Pouring contempt upon princes, And the girdle of the mighty He made feeble.
[12:22] Removing deep things out of darkness, And He bringeth out to light death-shade.
[12:23] Magnifying the nations, and He destroyeth them, Spreading out the nations, and He quieteth them.
[12:24] Turning aside the heart Of the heads of the people of the land, And he causeth them to wander In vacancy -- no way!
[12:25] They feel darkness, and not light, He causeth them to wander as a drunkard.

[91:1] He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,
[91:2] He is saying of Jehovah, `My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,'
[91:3] For He delivereth thee from the snare of a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.
[91:4] With His pinion He covereth thee over, And under His wings thou dost trust, A shield and buckler `is' His truth.
[91:5] Thou art not afraid of fear by night, Of arrow that flieth by day,
[91:6] Of pestilence in thick darkness that walketh, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,
[91:7] There fall at thy side a thousand, And a myriad at thy right hand, Unto thee it cometh not nigh.
[91:8] But with thine eyes thou lookest, And the reward of the wicked thou seest,
[91:9] (For Thou, O Jehovah, `art' my refuge,) The Most High thou madest thy habitation.
[91:10] Evil happeneth not unto thee, And a plague cometh not near thy tent,
[91:11] For His messengers He chargeth for thee, To keep thee in all thy ways,
[91:12] On the hands they bear thee up, Lest thou smite against a stone thy foot.
[91:13] On lion and asp thou treadest, Thou trampest young lion and dragon.
[91:14] Because in Me he hath delighted, I also deliver him -- I set him on high, Because he hath known My name.
[91:15] He doth call Me, and I answer him, I `am' with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him.
[91:16] With length of days I satisfy him, And I cause him to look on My salvation!

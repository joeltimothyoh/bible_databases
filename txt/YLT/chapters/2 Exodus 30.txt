[30:1] `And thou hast made an altar `for' making perfume; `of' shittim wood thou dost make it;
[30:2] a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is square), and two cubits its height; its horns `are' of the same.
[30:3] `And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou hast made to it a crown of gold round about;
[30:4] and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown; on its two ribs thou dost make `them', on its two sides, and they have become places for staves, to bear it with them.
[30:5] `And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold;
[30:6] and thou hast put it before the vail, which `is' by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which `is' over the testimony, whither I am met with thee.
[30:7] `And Aaron hath made perfume on it, perfume of spices, morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he doth perfume it,
[30:8] and in Aaron's causing the lamps to go up between the evenings, he doth perfume it; a continual perfume before Jehovah to your generations.
[30:9] `Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on it;
[30:10] and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns, once in a year, by the blood of the sin-offering of atonements; once in a year doth he make atonement for it, to your generations; it `is' most holy to Jehovah.'
[30:11] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[30:12] `When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for their numbers, then they have given each an atonement `for' his soul to Jehovah in their being numbered, and there is no plague among them in their being numbered.
[30:13] `This they do give, every one passing over unto those numbered, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel `is' twenty gerahs); half a shekel `is' the heave-offering to Jehovah;
[30:14] every one passing over unto those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upwards, doth give the heave-offering of Jehovah;
[30:15] the rich doth not multiply, and the poor doth not diminish from the half-shekel, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
[30:16] `And thou hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of Israel, and hast given it for the service of the tent of meeting; and it hath been to the sons of Israel for a memorial before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.'
[30:17] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[30:18] `And thou hast made a laver of brass (and its base of brass), for washing; and thou hast put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there;
[30:19] and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and their feet,
[30:20] in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash `with' water, and die not; or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister, to perfume a fire-offering to Jehovah,
[30:21] then they have washed their hands and their feet, and they die not, and it hath been to them a statute age-during, to him and to his seed to their generations.'
[30:22] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[30:23] `And thou, take to thyself principal spices, wild honey five hundred `shekels'; and spice-cinnamon, the half of that, two hundred and fifty; and spice-cane two hundred and fifty;
[30:24] and cassia five hundred, by the shekel of the sanctuary, and olive oil a hin;
[30:25] and thou hast made it a holy anointing oil, a compound mixture, work of a compounder; it is a holy anointing oil.
[30:26] `And thou hast anointed with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,
[30:27] and the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of perfume,
[30:28] and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base;
[30:29] and thou hast sanctified them, and they have been most holy; all that is coming against them is holy;
[30:30] and Aaron and his sons thou dost anoint, and hast sanctified them for being priests to Me.
[30:31] `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, A holy anointing oil is this to Me, to your generations;
[30:32] on flesh of man it is not poured, and with its proper proportion ye make none like it; it `is' holy; it is holy to you;
[30:33] a man who compoundeth `any' like it, or who putteth of it on a stranger -- hath even been cut off from his people.'
[30:34] And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Take to thee spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense; they are part for part;
[30:35] and thou hast made it a perfume, a compound, work of a compounder, salted, pure, holy;
[30:36] and thou hast beaten `some' of it small, and hast put of it before the testimony, in the tent of meeting, whither I am met with thee; most holy it is to you.
[30:37] `As to the perfume which thou makest, with its proper proportion ye do not make to yourselves, holy it is to thee to Jehovah;
[30:38] a man who maketh `any' like it -- to be refreshed by it -- hath even been cut off from his people.'

[106:1] Praise ye Jah, give thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, `is' His kindness.
[106:2] Who doth utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Soundeth all His praise?
[106:3] O the happiness of those keeping judgment, Doing righteousness at all times.
[106:4] Remember me, O Jehovah, With the favour of Thy people, Look after me in Thy salvation.
[106:5] To look on the good of Thy chosen ones, To rejoice in the joy of Thy nation, To boast myself with Thine inheritance.
[106:6] We have sinned with our fathers, We have done perversely, we have done wickedly.
[106:7] Our fathers in Egypt, Have not considered wisely Thy wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of Thy kind acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.
[106:8] And He saveth them for His name's sake, To make known His might,
[106:9] And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is dried up, And causeth them to go Through depths as a wilderness.
[106:10] And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating, And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.
[106:11] And waters cover their adversaries, One of them hath not been left.
[106:12] And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,
[106:13] They have hasted -- forgotten His works, They have not waited for His counsel.
[106:14] And they lust greatly in a wilderness, And try God in a desert.
[106:15] And He giveth to them their request, And sendeth leanness into their soul.
[106:16] And they are envious of Moses in the camp, Of Aaron, Jehovah's holy one.
[106:17] Earth openeth, and swalloweth up Dathan, And covereth over the company of Abiram.
[106:18] And fire burneth among their company, A flame setteth on fire the wicked.
[106:19] They make a calf in Horeb, And bow themselves to a molten image,
[106:20] And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating herbs.
[106:21] They have forgotten God their saviour, The doer of great things in Egypt,
[106:22] Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, Of fearful things by the sea of Suph.
[106:23] And He saith to destroy them, Unless Moses, His chosen one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back His wrath from destroying.
[106:24] And they kick against the desirable land, They have not given credence to His word.
[106:25] And they murmur in their tents, They have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah.
[106:26] And He lifteth up His hand to them, To cause them to fall in a wilderness,
[106:27] And to cause their seed to fall among nations, And to scatter them through lands.
[106:28] And they are coupled to Baal-Peor, And eat the sacrifices of the dead,
[106:29] And they provoke to anger by their actions, And a plague breaketh forth upon them,
[106:30] And Phinehas standeth, and executeth judgment, And the plague is restrained,
[106:31] And it is reckoned to him to righteousness, To all generations -- unto the age.
[106:32] And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,
[106:33] For they have provoked his spirit, And he speaketh wrongfully with his lips.
[106:34] They have not destroyed the peoples, As Jehovah had said to them,
[106:35] And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,
[106:36] And serve their idols, And they are to them for a snare.
[106:37] And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to destroyers,
[106:38] And they shed innocent blood -- Blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.
[106:39] And they are defiled with their works, And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.
[106:40] And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled against His people, And He doth abominate His inheritance.
[106:41] And giveth them into the hand of nations, And those hating them rule over them,
[106:42] And their enemies oppress them, And they are humbled under their hand.
[106:43] Many times He doth deliver them, And they rebel in their counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.
[106:44] And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their cry,
[106:45] And remembereth for them His covenant, And is comforted, According to the abundance of His kindness.
[106:46] And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their captors.
[106:47] Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To glory in Thy praise.
[106:48] Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age even unto the age. And all the people said, `Amen, praise Jah!'

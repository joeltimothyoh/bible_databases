[28:1] Surely there is for silver a source, And a place for the gold they refine;
[28:2] Iron from the dust is taken, And `from' the firm stone brass.
[28:3] An end hath he set to darkness, And to all perfection he is searching, A stone of darkness and death-shade.
[28:4] A stream hath broken out from a sojourner, Those forgotten of the foot, They were low, from man they wandered.
[28:5] The earth! from it cometh forth bread, And its under-part is turned like fire.
[28:6] A place of the sapphire `are' its stones, And it hath dust of gold.
[28:7] A path -- not known it hath a ravenous fowl, Nor scorched it hath an eye of the kite,
[28:8] Nor trodden it have the sons of pride, Not passed over it hath the fierce lion.
[28:9] Against the flint he sent forth his hand, He overturned from the root mountains.
[28:10] Among rocks, brooks he hath cleaved, And every precious thing hath his eye seen.
[28:11] From overflowing floods he hath bound, And the hidden thing bringeth out `to' light.
[28:12] And the wisdom -- whence is it found? And where `is' this, the place of understanding?
[28:13] Man hath not known its arrangement, Nor is it found in the land of the living.
[28:14] The deep hath said, `It `is' not in me,' And the sea hath said, `It is not with me.'
[28:15] Gold is not given for it, Nor is silver weighed -- its price.
[28:16] It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, With precious onyx and sapphire,
[28:17] Not equal it do gold and crystal, Nor `is' its exchange a vessel of fine gold.
[28:18] Corals and pearl are not remembered, The acquisition of wisdom `is' above rubies.
[28:19] Not equal it doth the topaz of Cush, With pure gold it is not valued.
[28:20] And the wisdom -- whence doth it come? And where `is' this, the place of understanding?
[28:21] It hath been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the fowl of the heavens It hath been hidden.
[28:22] Destruction and death have said: `With our ears we have heard its fame.'
[28:23] God hath understood its way, And He hath known its place.
[28:24] For He to the ends of the earth doth look, Under the whole heavens He doth see,
[28:25] To make for the wind a weight, And the waters He meted out in measure.
[28:26] In His making for the rain a limit, And a way for the brightness of the voices,
[28:27] Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it, and also searched it out,
[28:28] And He saith to man: -- `Lo, fear of the Lord, that `is' wisdom, And to turn from evil `is' understanding.'

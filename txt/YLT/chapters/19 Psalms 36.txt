[36:1] To the Overseer. -- By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, `Fear of God is not before his eyes,
[36:2] For he made `it' smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.
[36:3] The words of his mouth `are' iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently -- to do good.
[36:4] Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'
[36:5] O Jehovah, in the heavens `is' Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness `is' unto the clouds.
[36:6] Thy righteousness `is' as mountains of God, Thy judgments `are' a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah.
[36:7] How precious `is' Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.
[36:8] They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.
[36:9] For with Thee `is' a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light.
[36:10] Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.
[36:11] Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.
[36:12] There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!

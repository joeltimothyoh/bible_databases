[4:1] We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,
[4:2] for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,
[4:3] for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,
[4:4] for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh `day' thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'
[4:5] and in this `place' again, `If they shall enter into My rest -- ;'
[4:6] since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --
[4:7] again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'
[4:8] for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;
[4:9] there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,
[4:10] for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.
[4:11] May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,
[4:12] for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;
[4:13] and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things `are' naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning.
[4:14] Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,
[4:15] for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but `one' tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin;
[4:16] we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help.

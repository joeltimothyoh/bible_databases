[9:1] `Rejoice not, O Israel, be not joyful like the peoples, For thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God, Thou hast loved a gift near all floors of corn.
[9:2] Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth fail in her,
[9:3] They do not abide in the land of Jehovah, And turned back hath Ephraim `to' Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they eat.
[9:4] They pour not out wine to Jehovah, Nor are they sweet to Him, Their sacrifices `are' as bread of mourners to them, All eating it are unclean: For their bread `is' for themselves, It doth not come into the house of Jehovah.
[9:5] What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah's festival?
[9:6] For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of their silver, Nettles possess them -- a thorn `is' in their tents.
[9:7] Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool `is' the prophet, Mad `is' the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine iniquity, And great `is' the hatred.
[9:8] Ephraim is looking `away' from My God, The prophet! a snare of a fowler `is' over all his ways, Hatred `is' in the house of his God.
[9:9] They have gone deep -- have done corruptly, As `in' the days of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect their sins.
[9:10] As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your fathers, They -- they have gone in `to' Baal-Peor, And are separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like their love.
[9:11] Ephraim `is' as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without birth, And without womb, and without conception.
[9:12] For though they nourish their sons, I have made them childless -- without man, Surely also, wo to them, when I turn aside from them.
[9:13] Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in comeliness, And Ephraim `is' to bring out unto a slayer his sons.
[9:14] Give to them, Jehovah -- what dost Thou give? Give to them miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.
[9:15] All their evil `is' in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads `are' apostates.
[9:16] Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to death the desired of their womb.
[9:17] Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to Him, And they are wanderers among nations!

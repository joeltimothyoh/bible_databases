[28:1] By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, My rock, be not silent to me! Lest Thou be silent to me, And I have been compared With those going down to the pit.
[28:2] Hear the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee, In my lifting up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
[28:3] Draw me not with the wicked, And with workers of iniquity, Speaking peace with their neighbours, And evil in their heart.
[28:4] Give to them according to their acting, And according to the evil of their doings. According to the work of their hands give to them. Return their deed to them.
[28:5] For they attend not to the doing of Jehovah, And unto the work of His hands. He throweth them down, And doth not build them up.
[28:6] Blessed `is' Jehovah, For He hath heard the voice of my supplications.
[28:7] Jehovah `is' my strength, and my shield, In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exulteth, And with my song I thank Him.
[28:8] Jehovah `is' strength to him, Yea, the strength of the salvation of His anointed `is' He.
[28:9] Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance, And feed them, and carry them to the age!

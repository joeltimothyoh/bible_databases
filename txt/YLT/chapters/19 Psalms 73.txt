[73:1] A Psalm of Asaph. Only -- good to Israel `is' God, to the clean of heart. And I -- as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside,
[73:2] As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,
[73:3] The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,
[73:4] And their might `is' firm.
[73:5] In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.
[73:6] Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.
[73:7] Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;
[73:8] They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.
[73:9] They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walketh in the earth.
[73:10] Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.
[73:11] And they have said, `How hath God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'
[73:12] Lo, these `are' the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength.
[73:13] Only -- a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,
[73:14] And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof `is' every morning.
[73:15] If I have said, `I recount thus,' Lo, a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.
[73:16] And I think to know this, Perverseness it `is' in mine eyes,
[73:17] Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.
[73:18] Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.
[73:19] How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended -- consumed from terrors.
[73:20] As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image Thou despisest.
[73:21] For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,
[73:22] And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee.
[73:23] And I `am' continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on my right hand.
[73:24] With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost receive me.
[73:25] Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.
[73:26] Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion `is' God to the age.
[73:27] For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.
[73:28] And I -- nearness of God to me `is' good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!

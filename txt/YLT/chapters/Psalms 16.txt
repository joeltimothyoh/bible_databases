[16:1] A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee.
[16:2] Thou hast said to Jehovah, `My Lord Thou `art';' My good `is' not for thine own sake;
[16:3] For the holy ones who `are' in the land, And the honourable, all my delight `is' in them.
[16:4] Multiplied are their griefs, `Who' have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips.
[16:5] Jehovah `is' the portion of my share, and of my cup, Thou -- Thou dost uphold my lot.
[16:6] Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance `is' for me.
[16:7] I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me; Also `in' the nights my reins instruct me.
[16:8] I did place Jehovah before me continually, Because -- at my right hand I am not moved.
[16:9] Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:
[16:10] For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption.
[16:11] Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys `is' with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy right hand for ever!

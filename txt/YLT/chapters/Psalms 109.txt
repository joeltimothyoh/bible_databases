[109:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, be not silent,
[109:2] For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me -- A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!
[109:3] They have compassed me about, And they fight me without cause.
[109:4] For my love they oppose me, and I -- prayer!
[109:5] And they set against me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
[109:6] Appoint Thou over him the wicked, And an adversary standeth at his right hand.
[109:7] In his being judged, he goeth forth wicked, And his prayer is for sin.
[109:8] His days are few, his oversight another taketh,
[109:9] His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.
[109:10] And wander continually do his sons, Yea, they have begged, And have sought out of their dry places.
[109:11] An exactor layeth a snare for all that he hath, And strangers spoil his labour.
[109:12] He hath none to extend kindness, Nor is there one showing favour to his orphans.
[109:13] His posterity is for cutting off, In another generation is their name blotted out.
[109:14] The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Jehovah, And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.
[109:15] They are before Jehovah continually, And He cutteth off from earth their memorial.
[109:16] Because that he hath not remembered to do kindness, And pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of heart -- to slay,
[109:17] And he loveth reviling, and it meeteth him, And he hath not delighted in blessing, And it is far from him.
[109:18] And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst, And as oil into his bones.
[109:19] It is to him as apparel -- he covereth himself, And for a continual girdle he girdeth it on.
[109:20] This `is' the wage of mine accusers from Jehovah, And of those speaking evil against my soul.
[109:21] And Thou, O Jehovah Lord, Deal with me for Thy name's sake, Because Thy kindness `is' good, deliver me.
[109:22] For I `am' poor and needy, And my heart hath been pierced in my midst.
[109:23] As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone, I have been driven away as a locust.
[109:24] My knees have been feeble from fasting, And my flesh hath failed of fatness.
[109:25] And I -- I have been a reproach to them, They see me, they shake their head.
[109:26] Help me, O Jehovah my God, Save me, according to Thy kindness.
[109:27] And they know that this `is' Thy hand, Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast done it.
[109:28] They revile, and Thou dost bless, They have risen, and are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice.
[109:29] Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an upper robe `is' their shame.
[109:30] I thank Jehovah greatly with my mouth, And in the midst of many I praise Him,
[109:31] For He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save from those judging his soul.

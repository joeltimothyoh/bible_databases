[2:1] My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,
[2:2] To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,
[2:3] For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,
[2:4] If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,
[2:5] Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.
[2:6] For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.
[2:7] Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.
[2:8] To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.
[2:9] Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness -- every good path.
[2:10] For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,
[2:11] Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,
[2:12] To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,
[2:13] Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,
[2:14] Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,
[2:15] Whose paths `are' crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.
[2:16] To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,
[2:17] Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.
[2:18] For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.
[2:19] None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.
[2:20] That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.
[2:21] For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,
[2:22] And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!

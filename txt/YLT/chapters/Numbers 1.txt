[1:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, saying:
[1:2] `Take ye up the sum of all the company of the sons of Israel by their families, by the house of their fathers, in the number of names -- every male by their polls;
[1:3] from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host in Israel, ye do number them by their hosts, thou and Aaron;
[1:4] and with you there is a man for a tribe, each is a head to the house of his fathers.
[1:5] `And these `are' the names of the men who stand with you: `For Reuben -- Elizur son of Shedeur.

[1:16] These `are' those called of the company, princes of the tribes of their fathers; they `are' heads of the thousands of Israel.
[1:17] And Moses taketh -- Aaron also -- these men, who were defined by name,
[1:18] and all the company they assembled on the first of the second month, and they declare their births, by their families, by the house of their fathers, in the number of names from a son of twenty years and upward, by their polls,
[1:19] as Jehovah hath commanded Moses; and he numbereth them in the wilderness of Sinai.
[1:20] And the sons of Reuben, Israel's first-born -- their births, by their families, by the house of their fathers, in the number of names, by their polls, every male from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host --

[1:44] These `are' those numbered, whom Moses numbered -- Aaron also, and the princes of Israel, twelve men -- each for the house of his fathers, they have been.
[1:45] And they are, all those numbered of the sons of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host in Israel,
[1:46] yea, all those numbered are six hundred thousand, and three thousand, and five hundred and fifty.
[1:47] And the Levites, for the tribe of their fathers, have not numbered themselves in their midst,
[1:48] seeing Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[1:49] `Only, the tribe of Levi thou dost not number, and their sum thou dost not take up in the midst of the sons of Israel;
[1:50] and thou, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all that it hath; they bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels, and they serve it; and round about the tabernacle they encamp.
[1:51] `And in the journeying of the tabernacle, the Levites take it down, and in the encamping of the tabernacle, the Levites raise it up; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'
[1:52] And the sons of Israel have encamped, each by his camp, and each by his standard, by their hosts;
[1:53] and the Levites encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony; and there is no wrath on the company of the sons of Israel, and the Levites have kept the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.
[1:54] And the sons of Israel do according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses; so they have done.

[94:1] God of vengeance -- Jehovah! God of vengeance, shine forth.
[94:2] Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud.
[94:3] Till when `do' the wicked, O Jehovah? Till when do the wicked exult?
[94:4] They utter -- they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves.
[94:5] Thy people, O Jehovah, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict.
[94:6] Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder.
[94:7] And they say, `Jehovah doth not see, And the God of Jacob doth not consider.'
[94:8] Consider, ye brutish among the people, And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?
[94:9] He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?
[94:10] He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge `is' Jehovah.
[94:11] He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they `are' vanity.
[94:12] O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,
[94:13] To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked.
[94:14] For Jehovah leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not.
[94:15] For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,
[94:16] Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?
[94:17] Unless Jehovah `were' a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence.
[94:18] If I have said, `My foot hath slipped,' Thy kindness, O Jehovah, supporteth me.
[94:19] In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.
[94:20] Is a throne of mischief joined `with' Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?
[94:21] They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.
[94:22] And Jehovah is for a high place to me, And my God `is' for a rock -- my refuge,
[94:23] And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Jehovah our God doth cut them off!

[4:1] And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and saith, `I have gotten a man by Jehovah;'
[4:2] and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground.
[4:3] And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;
[4:4] and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah looketh unto Abel and unto his present,
[4:5] and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.
[4:6] And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?
[4:7] Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.'
[4:8] And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, ``Let us go into the field;'' and it cometh to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him.
[4:9] And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Where `is' Abel thy brother?' and he saith, `I have not known; my brother's keeper -- I?'
[4:10] And He saith, `What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;
[4:11] and now, cursed `art' thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;
[4:12] when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee -- a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.'
[4:13] And Cain saith unto Jehovah, `Greater is my punishment than to be borne;
[4:14] lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been -- every one finding me doth slay me.'
[4:15] And Jehovah saith to him, `Therefore -- of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Jehovah setteth to Cain a token that none finding him doth slay him.
[4:16] And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden;
[4:17] and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of the city, according to the name of his son -- Enoch.
[4:18] And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech.
[4:19] And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.
[4:20] And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;
[4:21] and the name of his brother `is' Jubal, he hath been father of every one handling harp and organ.
[4:22] And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain `is' Naamah.
[4:23] And Lamech saith to his wives: -- `Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear `to' my saying: For a man I have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;
[4:24] For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy and sevenfold.'
[4:25] And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name Seth, `for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:' for Cain had slain him.
[4:26] And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Jehovah.

[7:1] Better `is' a name than good perfume, And the day of death than the day of birth.
[7:2] Better to go unto a house of mourning, Than to go unto a house of banqueting, For that is the end of all men, And the living layeth `it' unto his heart.
[7:3] Better `is' sorrow than laughter, For by the sadness of the face the heart becometh better.
[7:4] The heart of the wise `is' in a house of mourning, And the heart of fools in a house of mirth.
[7:5] Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man, Than `for' a man to hear a song of fools,
[7:6] For as the noise of thorns under the pot, So `is' the laughter of a fool, even this `is' vanity.
[7:7] Surely oppression maketh the wise mad, And a gift destroyeth the heart.
[7:8] Better `is' the latter end of a thing than its beginning, Better `is' the patient of spirit, than the haughty of spirit.
[7:9] Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, For anger in the bosom of fools resteth.
[7:10] Say not thou, `What was it, That the former days were better than these?' For thou hast not asked wisely of this.
[7:11] Wisdom `is' good with an inheritance, And an advantage `it is' to those beholding the sun.
[7:12] For wisdom `is' a defense, money `is' a defence, And the advantage of the knowledge of wisdom `is', She reviveth her possessors.
[7:13] See the work of God, For who is able to make straight that which He made crooked?
[7:14] In a day of prosperity be in gladness, And in a day of evil consider. Also this over-against that hath God made, To the intent that man doth not find anything after him.
[7:15] The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is a wrong-doer prolonging `himself' in his wrong.
[7:16] Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise, why art thou desolate?
[7:17] Do not much wrong, neither be thou a fool, why dost thou die within thy time?
[7:18] `It is' good that thou dost lay hold on this, and also, from that withdrawest not thy hand, for whoso is fearing God goeth out with them all.
[7:19] The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man, more than wealth the rulers who have been in a city.
[7:20] Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth good and sinneth not.
[7:21] Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart, that thou hear not thy servant reviling thee.
[7:22] For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself also hast reviled others.
[7:23] All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said, `I am wise,' and it `is' far from me.
[7:24] Far off `is' that which hath been, and deep, deep, who doth find it?
[7:25] I have turned round, also my heart, to know and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and reason, and to know the wrong of folly, and of foolishness the madness.
[7:26] And I am finding more bitter than death, the woman whose heart `is' nets and snares, her hands `are' bands; the good before God escapeth from her, but the sinner is captured by her.
[7:27] See, this I have found, said the Preacher, one to one, to find out the reason
[7:28] (that still my soul had sought, and I had not found), One man, a teacher, I have found, and a woman among all these I have not found.
[7:29] See, this alone I have found, that God made man upright, and they -- they have sought out many devices.

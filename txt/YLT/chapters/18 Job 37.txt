[37:1] Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its place.
[37:2] Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the sound from His mouth goeth forth.
[37:3] Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light `is' over the skirts of the earth.
[37:4] After it roar doth a voice -- He thundereth with the voice of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His voice is heard.
[37:5] God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great things and we know not.
[37:6] For to snow He saith, `Be `on' the earth.' And the small rain and great rain of His power.
[37:7] Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by all men of His work.
[37:8] And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its habitations it doth continue.
[37:9] From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from scatterings winds -- cold,
[37:10] From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of waters is straitened,
[37:11] Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud doth His light.
[37:12] And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable earth.
[37:13] Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness -- He doth cause it to come.
[37:14] Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.
[37:15] Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to shine the light of His cloud?
[37:16] Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?
[37:17] How thy garments `are' warm, In the quieting of the earth from the south?
[37:18] Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds -- strong as a hard mirror!
[37:19] Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array because of darkness.
[37:20] Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken, surely he is swallowed up.
[37:21] And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it `is' in the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them.
[37:22] From the golden north it cometh, Beside God `is' fearful honour.
[37:23] The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,
[37:24] Therefore do men fear Him, He seeth not any of the wise of heart.

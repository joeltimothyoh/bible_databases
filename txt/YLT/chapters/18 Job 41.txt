[41:1] Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope thou lettest down -- his tongue?
[41:2] Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce his jaw?
[41:3] Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak unto thee tender things?
[41:4] Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a servant age-during?
[41:5] Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him for thy damsels?
[41:6] (Feast upon him do companions, They divide him among the merchants!)
[41:7] Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with fish-spears his head?
[41:8] Place on him thy hand, Remember the battle -- do not add!
[41:9] Lo, the hope of him is found a liar, Also at his appearance is not one cast down?
[41:10] None so fierce that he doth awake him, And who `is' he before Me stationeth himself?
[41:11] Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole heavens it `is' mine.
[41:12] I do not keep silent concerning his parts, And the matter of might, And the grace of his arrangement.
[41:13] Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his double bridle who doth enter?
[41:14] The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his teeth `are' terrible.
[41:15] A pride -- strong ones of shields, Shut up -- a close seal.
[41:16] One unto another they draw nigh, And air doth not enter between them.
[41:17] One unto another they adhere, They stick together and are not separated.
[41:18] His sneezings cause light to shine, And his eyes `are' as the eyelids of the dawn.
[41:19] Out of his mouth do flames go, sparks of fire escape.
[41:20] Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke, As a blown pot and reeds.
[41:21] His breath setteth coals on fire, And a flame from his mouth goeth forth.
[41:22] In his neck lodge doth strength, And before him doth grief exult.
[41:23] The flakes of his flesh have adhered -- Firm upon him -- it is not moved.
[41:24] His heart `is' firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the lower piece.
[41:25] From his rising are the mighty afraid, From breakings they keep themselves free.
[41:26] The sword of his overtaker standeth not, Spear -- dart -- and lance.
[41:27] He reckoneth iron as straw, brass as rotten wood.
[41:28] The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee, Turned by him into stubble are stones of the sling.
[41:29] As stubble have darts been reckoned, And he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.
[41:30] Under him `are' sharp points of clay, He spreadeth gold on the mire.
[41:31] He causeth to boil as a pot the deep, The sea he maketh as a pot of ointment.
[41:32] After him he causeth a path to shine, One thinketh the deep to be hoary.
[41:33] There is not on the earth his like, That is made without terror.
[41:34] Every high thing he doth see, He `is' king over all sons of pride.

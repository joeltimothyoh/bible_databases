[10:1] Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,
[10:2] Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.
[10:3] Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Jehovah.
[10:4] The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. `God is not!' `are' all his devices.
[10:5] Pain do his ways at all times, On high `are' Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them.
[10:6] He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,' To generation and generation not in evil.
[10:7] Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue `is' perverseness and iniquity,
[10:8] He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,
[10:9] He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.
[10:10] He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.
[10:11] He said in his heart, `God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.'
[10:12] Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble.
[10:13] Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, `It is not required.'
[10:14] Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave `it', Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.
[10:15] Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;
[10:16] Jehovah `is' king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!
[10:17] The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,
[10:18] To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!

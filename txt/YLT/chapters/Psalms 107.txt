[107:1] `Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age `is' His kindness:'
[107:2] Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.
[107:3] And from the lands hath gathered them, From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.
[107:4] They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.
[107:5] Hungry -- yea -- thirsty, Their soul in them becometh feeble,
[107:6] And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,
[107:7] And causeth them to tread in a right way, To go unto a city of habitation.
[107:8] They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.
[107:9] For He hath satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul hath filled `with' goodness.
[107:10] Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,
[107:11] Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.
[107:12] And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.
[107:13] And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.
[107:14] He bringeth them out from the dark place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.
[107:15] They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.
[107:16] For He hath broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He hath cut.
[107:17] Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.
[107:18] All food doth their soul abominate, And they come nigh unto the gates of death,
[107:19] And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,
[107:20] He sendeth His word and healeth them, And delivereth from their destructions.
[107:21] They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,
[107:22] And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.
[107:23] Those going down `to' the sea in ships, Doing business in many waters,
[107:24] They have seen the works of Jehovah, And His wonders in the deep.
[107:25] And He saith, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,
[107:26] They go up `to' the heavens, they go down `to' the depths, Their soul in evil is melted.
[107:27] They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
[107:28] And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity, And from their distresses He bringeth them out.
[107:29] He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are their billows.
[107:30] And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.
[107:31] They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,
[107:32] And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.
[107:33] He maketh rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of waters become dry land.
[107:34] A fruitful land becometh a barren place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.
[107:35] He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.
[107:36] And He causeth the hungry to dwell there, And they prepare a city of habitation.
[107:37] And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.
[107:38] And He blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He doth not diminish.
[107:39] And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.
[107:40] He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And causeth them to wander in vacancy -- no way.
[107:41] And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And placeth families as a flock.
[107:42] The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity hath shut her mouth.
[107:43] Who `is' wise, and observeth these? They understand the kind acts of Jehovah!

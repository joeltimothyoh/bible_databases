[23:1] And Job answereth and saith: --
[23:2] Also -- to-day `is' my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.
[23:3] O that I had known -- and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,
[23:4] I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill `with' arguments.
[23:5] I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.
[23:6] In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth `it' in me.
[23:7] There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.
[23:8] Lo, forward I go -- and He is not, And backward -- and I perceive him not.
[23:9] `To' the left in His working -- and I see not, He is covered `on' the right, and I behold not.
[23:10] For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me -- as gold I go forth.
[23:11] On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,
[23:12] The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.
[23:13] And He `is' in one `mind', And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired -- and He doth `it'.
[23:14] For He doth complete my portion, And many such things `are' with Him.
[23:15] Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.
[23:16] And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.
[23:17] For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.

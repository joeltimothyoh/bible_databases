[82:1] -- A Psalm of Asaph. God hath stood in the company of God, In the midst God doth judge.
[82:2] Till when do ye judge perversely? And the face of the wicked lift up? Selah.
[82:3] Judge ye the weak and fatherless, The afflicted and the poor declare righteous.
[82:4] Let the weak and needy escape, From the hand of the wicked deliver them.
[82:5] They knew not, nor do they understand, In darkness they walk habitually, Moved are all the foundations of earth.
[82:6] I -- I have said, `Gods ye `are', And sons of the Most High -- all of you,
[82:7] But as man ye die, and as one of the heads ye fall,
[82:8] Rise, O God, judge the earth, For Thou hast inheritance among all the nations!

[50:1] A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods -- Jehovah -- hath spoken, And He calleth to the earth From the rising of the sun unto its going in.
[50:2] From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.
[50:3] Our God cometh, and is not silent, Fire before Him doth devour, And round about him it hath been very tempestuous.
[50:4] He doth call unto the heavens from above, And unto the earth, to judge His people.
[50:5] Gather ye to Me My saints, Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.
[50:6] And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself `is' judge. Selah.
[50:7] Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel, and I testify against thee, God, thy God `am' I.
[50:8] Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee, Yea, thy burnt-offerings `Are' before Me continually.
[50:9] I take not from thy house a bullock, From thy folds he goats.
[50:10] For Mine `is' every beast of the forest, The cattle on the hills of oxen.
[50:11] I have known every fowl of the mountains, And the wild beast of the field `is' with Me.
[50:12] If I am hungry I tell not to thee, For Mine `is' the world and its fulness.
[50:13] Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink the blood of he-goats?
[50:14] Sacrifice to God confession, And complete to the Most High thy vows.
[50:15] And call Me in a day of adversity, I deliver thee, and thou honourest Me.
[50:16] And to the wicked hath God said: What to thee -- to recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on thy mouth?
[50:17] Yea, thou hast hated instruction, And dost cast My words behind thee.
[50:18] If thou hast seen a thief, Then thou art pleased with him, And with adulterers `is' thy portion.
[50:19] Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with evil, And thy tongue joineth deceit together,
[50:20] Thou sittest, against thy brother thou speakest, Against a son of thy mother givest slander.
[50:21] These thou didst, and I kept silent, Thou hast thought that I am like thee, I reprove thee, and set in array before thine eyes.
[50:22] Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are forgetting God, Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.
[50:23] He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me, As to him who maketh a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of God!

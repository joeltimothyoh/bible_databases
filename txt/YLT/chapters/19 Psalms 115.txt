[115:1] Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.
[115:2] Why do the nations say, `Where, pray, `is' their God.
[115:3] And our God `is' in the heavens, All that He hath pleased He hath done.
[115:4] Their idols `are' silver and gold, work of man's hands,
[115:5] A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
[115:6] Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,
[115:7] Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;
[115:8] Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
[115:9] O Israel, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield `is' He.'
[115:10] O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield `is' He.'
[115:11] Ye fearing Jehovah, trust in Jehovah, `Their help and their shield `is' He.'
[115:12] Jehovah hath remembered us, He blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of Aaron,
[115:13] He blesseth those fearing Jehovah, The small with the great.
[115:14] Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.
[115:15] Blessed `are' ye of Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,
[115:16] The heavens -- the heavens `are' Jehovah's, And the earth He hath given to sons of men,
[115:17] The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.
[115:18] And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise ye Jah!

[104:1] Bless, O my soul, Jehovah! Jehovah, my God, Thou hast been very great, Honour and majesty Thou hast put on.
[104:2] Covering himself `with' light as a garment, Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,
[104:3] Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on wings of wind,
[104:4] Making His messengers -- the winds, His ministers -- the flaming fire.
[104:5] He hath founded earth on its bases, It is not moved to the age and for ever.
[104:6] The abyss! as with clothing Thou hast covered it, Above hills do waters stand.
[104:7] From Thy rebuke they flee, From the voice of Thy thunder haste away.
[104:8] They go up hills -- they go down valleys, Unto a place Thou hast founded for them.
[104:9] A border Thou hast set, they pass not over, They turn not back to cover the earth.
[104:10] Who is sending forth fountains in valleys, Between hills they go on.
[104:11] They water every beast of the field, Wild asses break their thirst.
[104:12] By them the fowl of the heavens doth dwell, From between the branches They give forth the voice.
[104:13] Watering hills from His upper chambers, From the fruit of Thy works is the earth satisfied.
[104:14] Causing grass to spring up for cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the earth,
[104:15] And wine -- it rejoiceth the heart of man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread -- the heart of man it supporteth.
[104:16] Satisfied `are' the trees of Jehovah, Cedars of Lebanon that He hath planted,
[104:17] Where birds do make nests, The stork -- the firs `are' her house.
[104:18] The high hills `are' for wild goats, Rocks `are' a refuge for conies,
[104:19] He made the moon for seasons, The sun hath known his place of entrance.
[104:20] Thou settest darkness, and it is night, In it doth every beast of the forest creep.
[104:21] The young lions are roaring for prey, And to seek from God their food.
[104:22] The sun riseth, they are gathered, And in their dens they crouch.
[104:23] Man goeth forth to his work, And to his service -- till evening.
[104:24] How many have been Thy works, O Jehovah, All of them in wisdom Thou hast made, Full is the earth of thy possessions.
[104:25] This, the sea, great and broad of sides, There `are' moving things -- innumerable, Living creatures -- small with great.
[104:26] There do ships go: leviathan, That Thou hast formed to play in it.
[104:27] All of them unto Thee do look, To give their food in its season.
[104:28] Thou dost give to them -- they gather, Thou dost open Thy hand -- they `are' satisfied `with' good.
[104:29] Thou hidest Thy face -- they are troubled, Thou gatherest their spirit -- they expire, And unto their dust they turn back.
[104:30] Thou sendest out Thy Spirit, they are created, And Thou renewest the face of the ground.
[104:31] The honour of Jehovah is to the age, Jehovah rejoiceth in His works,
[104:32] Who is looking to earth, and it trembleth, He cometh against hills, and they smoke.
[104:33] I sing to Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.
[104:34] Sweet is my meditation on Him, I -- I do rejoice in Jehovah.
[104:35] Consumed are sinners from the earth, And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah!

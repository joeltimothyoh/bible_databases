[26:1] By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.
[26:2] Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified `are' my reins and my heart.
[26:3] For Thy kindness `is' before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.
[26:4] I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.
[26:5] I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.
[26:6] I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.
[26:7] To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.
[26:8] Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.
[26:9] Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,
[26:10] In whose hand `is' a wicked device, And their right hand `is' full of bribes.
[26:11] And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.
[26:12] My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!

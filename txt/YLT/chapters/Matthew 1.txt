[1:1] A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
[1:2] Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,
[1:3] and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,
[1:4] and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
[1:5] and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
[1:6] and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of her `who had been' Uriah's,
[1:7] and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,
[1:8] and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,
[1:9] and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,
[1:10] and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,
[1:11] and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.
[1:12] And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,
[1:13] and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
[1:14] and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
[1:15] and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
[1:16] and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.
[1:17] All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David `are' fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.
[1:18] And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,
[1:19] and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.
[1:20] And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, `Joseph, son of David, thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which in her was begotten `is' of the Holy Spirit,
[1:21] and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'
[1:22] And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
[1:23] `Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted `With us `he is' God.'
[1:24] And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,
[1:25] and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.

[1:1] Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
[1:2] For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,
[1:3] For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,
[1:4] For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth -- knowledge and discretion.
[1:5] (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)
[1:6] For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.
[1:7] Fear of Jehovah `is' a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!
[1:8] Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,
[1:9] For a graceful wreath `are' they to thy head, And chains to thy neck.
[1:10] My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.
[1:11] If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,
[1:12] We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those going down `to' the pit,
[1:13] Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses `with' spoil,
[1:14] Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of us.'
[1:15] My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,
[1:16] For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.
[1:17] Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.
[1:18] And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.
[1:19] So `are' the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.
[1:20] Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,
[1:21] At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:
[1:22] `Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?
[1:23] Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.
[1:24] Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,
[1:25] And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.
[1:26] I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,
[1:27] When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.
[1:28] Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.
[1:29] Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.
[1:30] They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,
[1:31] And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.
[1:32] For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.
[1:33] And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And `is' quiet from fear of evil!'

[80:1] To the Overseer. -- `On the Lilies.' A testimony of Asaph. -- A Psalm. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Leading Joseph as a flock, Inhabiting the cherubs -- shine forth,
[80:2] Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, Wake up Thy might, and come for our salvation.
[80:3] O God, cause us to turn back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.
[80:4] Jehovah, God of Hosts, till when? Thou hast burned against the prayer of Thy people.
[80:5] Thou hast caused them to eat bread of tears, And causest them to drink With tears a third time.
[80:6] Thou makest us a strife to our neighbors, And our enemies mock at it.
[80:7] God of Hosts, turn us back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.
[80:8] A vine out of Egypt Thou dost bring, Thou dost cast out nations, and plantest it.
[80:9] Thou hast looked before it, and dost root it, And it filleth the land,
[80:10] Covered have been hills `with' its shadow, And its boughs `are' cedars of God.
[80:11] It sendeth forth its branches unto the sea, And unto the river its sucklings.
[80:12] Why hast Thou broken down its hedges, And all passing by the way have plucked it?
[80:13] A boar out of the forest doth waste it, And a wild beast of the fields consumeth it.
[80:14] God of Hosts, turn back, we beseech Thee, Look from heaven, and see, and inspect this vine,
[80:15] And the root that Thy right hand planted, And the branch Thou madest strong for Thee,
[80:16] Burnt with fire -- cut down, From the rebuke of Thy face they perish.
[80:17] Let Thy hand be on the man of Thy right hand, On the son of man Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.
[80:18] And we do not go back from Thee, Thou dost revive us, and in Thy name we call.
[80:19] O Jehovah, God of Hosts, turn us back, Cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved!

[7:1] My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with thee.
[7:2] Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of thine eye.
[7:3] Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the tablet of thy heart.
[7:4] Say to wisdom, `My sister Thou `art'.' And cry to understanding, `Kinswoman!'
[7:5] To preserve thee from a strange woman, From a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings.
[7:6] For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out,
[7:7] And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,
[7:8] Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way `to' her house he doth step,
[7:9] In the twilight -- in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness.
[7:10] And, lo, a woman to meet him -- (A harlot's dress, and watchful of heart,
[7:11] Noisy she `is', and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not.
[7:12] Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) --
[7:13] And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She hath hardened her face, and saith to him,
[7:14] `Sacrifices of peace-offerings `are' by me, To-day I have completed my vows.
[7:15] Therefore I have come forth to meet thee, To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee.
[7:16] `With' ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works -- cotton of Egypt.
[7:17] I sprinkled my bed -- myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
[7:18] Come, we are filled `with' loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.
[7:19] For the man is not in his house, He hath gone on a long journey.
[7:20] A bag of money he hath taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.'
[7:21] She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.
[7:22] He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool,
[7:23] Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it `is' for its life.
[7:24] And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth.
[7:25] Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths,
[7:26] For many `are' the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty `are' all her slain ones.
[7:27] The ways of Sheol -- her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death!

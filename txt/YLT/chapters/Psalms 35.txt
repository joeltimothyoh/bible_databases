[35:1] By David. Strive, Jehovah, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,
[35:2] Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,
[35:3] And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, `Thy salvation I `am'.'
[35:4] They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.
[35:5] They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah driving away.
[35:6] Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of Jehovah their pursuer.
[35:7] For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.
[35:8] Meet him doth desolation -- he knoweth not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.
[35:9] And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It rejoiceth in His salvation.
[35:10] All my bones say, `Jehovah, who is like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from his plunderer.'
[35:11] Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known they ask me.
[35:12] They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,
[35:13] And I -- in their sickness my clothing `is' sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom returneth.
[35:14] As `if' a friend, as `if' my brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.
[35:15] And -- in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;
[35:16] With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me their teeth.
[35:17] Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.
[35:18] I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I praise Thee.
[35:19] Mine enemies rejoice not over me `with' falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.
[35:20] For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,
[35:21] And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, `Aha, aha, our eye hath seen.'
[35:22] Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord -- be not far from me,
[35:23] Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea.
[35:24] Judge me according to Thy righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me.
[35:25] They do not say in their heart, `Aha, our desire.' They do not say, `We swallowed him up.'
[35:26] They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me.
[35:27] They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, `Jehovah is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.'
[35:28] And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy praise!

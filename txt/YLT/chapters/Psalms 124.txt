[124:1] A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save `for' Jehovah -- who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),
[124:2] Save `for' Jehovah -- who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,
[124:3] Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,
[124:4] Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,
[124:5] Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.
[124:6] Blessed `is' Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.
[124:7] Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
[124:8] Our help `is' in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!

[22:1] And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --
[22:2] To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself is profitable?
[22:3] Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?
[22:4] Because of thy reverence Doth He reason `with' thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:
[22:5] Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to thine iniquities.
[22:6] For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought, And the garments of the naked Thou dost strip off.
[22:7] Thou causest not the weary to drink water, And from the hungry thou withholdest bread.
[22:8] As to the man of arm -- he hath the earth, And the accepted of face -- he dwelleth in it.
[22:9] Widows thou hast sent away empty, And the arms of the fatherless are bruised.
[22:10] Therefore round about thee `are' snares, And trouble thee doth fear suddenly.
[22:11] Or darkness -- thou dost not see, And abundance of waters doth cover thee.
[22:12] Is not God high `in' heaven? And see the summit of the stars, That they are high.
[22:13] And thou hast said, `What -- hath God known? Through thickness doth He judge?
[22:14] Thick clouds `are' a secret place to Him, And He doth not see;' And the circle of the heavens He walketh habitually,
[22:15] The path of the age dost thou observe, That men of iniquity have trodden?
[22:16] Who have been cut down unexpectedly, A flood is poured out on their foundation.
[22:17] Those saying to God, `Turn aside from us,' And what doth the Mighty One to them?
[22:18] And he hath filled their houses `with' good: (And the counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)
[22:19] See do the righteous and they rejoice, And the innocent mocketh at them,
[22:20] `Surely our substance hath not been cut off, And their excellency hath fire consumed.'
[22:21] Acquaint thyself, I pray thee, with Him, And be at peace, Thereby thine increase `is' good.
[22:22] Receive, I pray thee, from His mouth a law, And set His sayings in thy heart.
[22:23] If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up, Thou puttest iniquity far from thy tents.
[22:24] So as to set on the dust a defence, And on a rock of the valleys a covering.
[22:25] And the Mighty hath been thy defence, And silver `is' strength to thee.
[22:26] For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself, And dost lift up unto God thy face,
[22:27] Thou dost make supplication unto Him, And He doth hear thee, And thy vows thou completest.
[22:28] And thou decreest a saying, And it is established to thee, And on thy ways hath light shone.
[22:29] For they have made low, And thou sayest, `Lift up.' And the bowed down of eyes he saveth.
[22:30] He delivereth the not innocent, Yea, he hath been delivered By the cleanness of thy hands.

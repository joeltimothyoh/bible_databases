[116:1] I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,
[116:2] Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.
[116:3] Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.
[116:4] And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,
[116:5] Gracious `is' Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God `is' merciful,
[116:6] A preserver of the simple `is' Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation.
[116:7] Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.
[116:8] For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.
[116:9] I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.
[116:10] I have believed, for I speak, I -- I have been afflicted greatly.
[116:11] I said in my haste, `Every man `is' a liar.'
[116:12] What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits `are' upon me.
[116:13] The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
[116:14] My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.
[116:15] Precious in the eyes of Jehovah `is' the death for His saints.
[116:16] Cause `it' to come, O Jehovah, for I `am' Thy servant. I `am' Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds.
[116:17] To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
[116:18] My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,
[116:19] In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!

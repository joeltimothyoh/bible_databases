[6:1] And working together also we call upon `you' that ye receive not in vain the grace of God --
[6:2] for He saith, `In an acceptable time I did hear thee, and in a day of salvation I did help thee, lo, now `is' a well-accepted time; lo, now, a day of salvation,' --
[6:3] in nothing giving any cause of offence, that the ministration may be not blamed,
[6:4] but in everything recommending ourselves as God's ministrants; in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,
[6:5] in stripes, in imprisonments, in insurrections, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
[6:6] in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
[6:7] in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the armour of the righteousness, on the right and on the left,
[6:8] through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as leading astray, and true;
[6:9] as unknown, and recognized; as dying, and lo, we live; as chastened, and not put to death;
[6:10] as sorrowful, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
[6:11] Our mouth hath been open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart hath been enlarged!
[6:12] ye are not straitened in us, and ye are straitened in your `own' bowels,
[6:13] and `as' a recompense of the same kind, (as to children I say `it',) be ye enlarged -- also ye!
[6:14] Become not yoked with others -- unbelievers, for what partaking `is there' to righteousness and lawlessness?
[6:15] and what fellowship to light with darkness? and what concord to Christ with Belial? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?
[6:16] and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols? for ye are a sanctuary of the living God, according as God said -- `I will dwell in them, and will walk among `them', and I will be their God, and they shall be My people,
[6:17] wherefore, come ye forth out of the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and an unclean thing do not touch, and I -- I will receive you,
[6:18] and I will be to you for a Father, and ye -- ye shall be to Me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.'

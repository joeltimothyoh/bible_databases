[7:1] `The Erring One,' by David, that he sung to Jehovah concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah, my God, in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.
[7:2] Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no deliverer.
[7:3] O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,
[7:4] If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary without cause,
[7:5] An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh, And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.
[7:6] Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment Thou hast commanded:
[7:7] And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high turn Thou back,
[7:8] Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O Jehovah, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity on me,
[7:9] Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.
[7:10] My shield `is' on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!
[7:11] God `is' a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all times.
[7:12] If `one' turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he hath trodden -- He prepareth it,
[7:13] Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.
[7:14] Lo, he travaileth `with' iniquity, And he hath conceived perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.
[7:15] A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth into a ditch he maketh.
[7:16] Return doth his perverseness on his head, And on his crown his violence cometh down.
[7:17] I thank Jehovah, According to His righteousness, And praise the name of Jehovah Most High!

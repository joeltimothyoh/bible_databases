[18:1] And he spake also a simile to them, that it behoveth `us' always to pray, and not to faint,
[18:2] saying, `A certain judge was in a certain city -- God he is not fearing, and man he is not regarding --
[18:3] and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him, saying, Do me justice on my opponent,
[18:4] and he would not for a time, but after these things he said in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do not regard,
[18:5] yet because this widow doth give me trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'
[18:6] And the Lord said, `Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith:
[18:7] and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long in regard to them?
[18:8] I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the faith upon the earth?'
[18:9] And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising the rest, this simile:
[18:10] `Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;
[18:11] the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;
[18:12] I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things -- as many as I possess.
[18:13] `And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me -- the sinner!
[18:14] I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'
[18:15] And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,
[18:16] and Jesus having called them near, said, `Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;
[18:17] verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'
[18:18] And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, `Good teacher, what having done -- shall I inherit life age-during?'
[18:19] And Jesus said to him, `Why me dost thou call good? no one `is' good, except One -- God;
[18:20] the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.'
[18:21] And he said, `All these I did keep from my youth;'
[18:22] and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, `Yet one thing to thee is lacking; all things -- as many as thou hast -- sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'
[18:23] and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.
[18:24] And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said, `How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God!
[18:25] for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'
[18:26] And those who heard, said, `And who is able to be saved?'
[18:27] and he said, `The things impossible with men are possible with God.'
[18:28] And Peter said, `Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;'
[18:29] and he said to them, `Verily I say to you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,
[18:30] who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age, life age-during.'
[18:31] And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, `Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed -- that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of Man,
[18:32] for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,
[18:33] and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.'
[18:34] And they none of these things understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.
[18:35] And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,
[18:36] and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring what this may be,
[18:37] and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by,
[18:38] and he cried out, saying, `Jesus, Son of David, deal kindly with me;'
[18:39] and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, `Son of David, deal kindly with me.'
[18:40] And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,
[18:41] saying, `What wilt thou I shall do to thee?' and he said, `Sir, that I may receive sight.'
[18:42] And Jesus said to him, `Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee;'
[18:43] and presently he did receive sight, and was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give praise to God.

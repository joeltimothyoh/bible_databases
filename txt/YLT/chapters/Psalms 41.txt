[41:1] To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of evil doth Jehovah deliver him.
[41:2] Jehovah doth preserve him and revive him, He is happy in the land, And Thou givest him not into the will of his enemies.
[41:3] Jehovah supporteth on a couch of sickness, All his bed Thou hast turned in his weakness.
[41:4] I -- I said, `O Jehovah, favour me, Heal my soul, for I did sin against Thee,'
[41:5] Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth -- his name hath perished!
[41:6] And if he came to see -- vanity he speaketh, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He goeth out -- at the street he speaketh.
[41:7] All hating me whisper together against me, Against me they devise evil to me:
[41:8] A thing of Belial is poured out on him, And because he lay down he riseth not again.
[41:9] Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One eating my bread, made great the heel against me,
[41:10] And Thou, Jehovah, favour me, And cause me to rise, And I give recompence to them.
[41:11] By this I have known, That Thou hast delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me.
[41:12] As to me, in mine integrity, Thou hast taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age.
[41:13] Blessed `is' Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age -- and unto the age. Amen and Amen.

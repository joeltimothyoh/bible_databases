[29:1] And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --
[29:2] Who doth make me as `in' months past, As `in' the days of God's preserving me?
[29:3] In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I walk `through' darkness.
[29:4] As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent.
[29:5] When yet the Mighty One `is' with me. Round about me -- my young ones,
[29:6] When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock `is' with me rivulets of oil.
[29:7] When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat.
[29:8] Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen -- they stood up.
[29:9] Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth.
[29:10] The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved.
[29:11] For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth `to' me.
[29:12] For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper.
[29:13] The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing.
[29:14] Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice.
[29:15] Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame `am' I.
[29:16] A father I `am' to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out.
[29:17] And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey.
[29:18] And I say, `With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.'
[29:19] My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch.
[29:20] My honour `is' fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed.
[29:21] To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel.
[29:22] After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,
[29:23] And they wait as `for' rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide `As' for the latter rain.
[29:24] I laugh unto them -- they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall.
[29:25] I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort.

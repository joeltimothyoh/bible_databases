[96:1] Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.
[96:2] Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.
[96:3] Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.
[96:4] For great `is' Jehovah, and praised greatly, Fearful He `is' over all gods.
[96:5] For all the gods of the peoples `are' nought, And Jehovah made the heavens.
[96:6] Honour and majesty `are' before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.
[96:7] Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.
[96:8] Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.
[96:9] Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.
[96:10] Say among nations, `Jehovah hath reigned, Also -- established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.'
[96:11] The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.
[96:12] The field exulteth, and all that `is' in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,
[96:13] Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!

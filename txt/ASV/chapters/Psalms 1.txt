[1:1] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:
[1:2] But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.
[1:3] And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
[1:4] The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
[1:5] Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
[1:6] For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.

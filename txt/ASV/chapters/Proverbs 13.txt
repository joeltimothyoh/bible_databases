[13:8] The ransom of a man's life is his riches; But the poor heareth no threatening.
[13:9] The light of the righteous rejoiceth; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
[13:10] By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom.
[13:11] Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; But he that gathereth by labor shall have increase.
[13:12] Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.
[13:13] Whoso despiseth the word bringeth destruction on himself; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
[13:14] The law of the wise is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death.

[13:24] He that spareth his rod hateth his son; But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.
[13:25] The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul; But the belly of the wicked shall want.

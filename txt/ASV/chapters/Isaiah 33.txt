[33:1] Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
[33:2] O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
[33:3] At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.
[33:4] And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it.
[33:5] Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
[33:6] And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.
[33:7] Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
[33:8] The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: `the enemy' hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.
[33:9] The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is confounded and withereth away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off `their leaves'.
[33:10] Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.
[33:11] Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
[33:12] And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
[33:13] Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
[33:14] The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?
[33:15] He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:
[33:16] He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given `him'; his waters shall be sure.
[33:17] Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.
[33:18] Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed `the tribute'? where is he that counted the towers?
[33:19] Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.
[33:20] Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
[33:21] But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
[33:22] For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.
[33:23] Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.
[33:24] And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

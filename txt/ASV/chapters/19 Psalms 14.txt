[14:1] The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.
[14:2] Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.
[14:3] They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
[14:4] Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people `as' they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?
[14:5] There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.
[14:6] Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.
[14:7] Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, `and' Israel shall be glad. Psalm 15 A Psalm of David.

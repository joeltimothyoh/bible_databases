[128:1] Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways.
[128:2] For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
[128:3] Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table.
[128:4] Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah.
[128:5] Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
[128:6] Yea, see thou thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel. Psalm 129 A Song of Ascents.

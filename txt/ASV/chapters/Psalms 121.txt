[121:1] I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come?
[121:2] My help `cometh' from Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
[121:3] He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
[121:4] Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.
[121:5] Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand.
[121:6] The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.
[121:7] Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; He will keep thy soul.
[121:8] Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth and for evermore. Psalm 122 A Song of Ascents; of David.

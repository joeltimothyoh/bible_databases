[69:1] Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my soul.
[69:2] I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
[69:3] I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
[69:4] They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore.
[69:5] O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee.
[69:6] Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
[69:7] Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face.
[69:8] I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother's children.
[69:9] For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.
[69:10] When I wept, `and chastened' my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.
[69:11] When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them.
[69:12] They that sit in the gate talk of me; And `I am' the song of the drunkards.
[69:13] But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.
[69:14] Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
[69:15] Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep shallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
[69:16] Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.
[69:17] And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
[69:18] Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies.
[69:19] Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee.
[69:20] Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.
[69:21] They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
[69:22] Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, `let it become' a trap.
[69:23] Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake.
[69:24] Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.
[69:25] Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.
[69:26] For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
[69:27] Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness.
[69:28] Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous.
[69:29] But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
[69:30] I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.
[69:31] And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, `Or' a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
[69:32] The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.
[69:33] For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners.
[69:34] Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein.
[69:35] For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
[69:36] The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein. Psalm 70 For the Chief Musician. `A Psalm' of David; to bring to remembrance.

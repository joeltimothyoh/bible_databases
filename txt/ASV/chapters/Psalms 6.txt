[6:1] O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
[6:2] Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.
[6:3] My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?
[6:4] Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake.
[6:5] For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
[6:6] I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
[6:7] Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.
[6:8] Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.
[6:9] Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.
[6:10] All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly. Psalm 7 Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehova, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite.

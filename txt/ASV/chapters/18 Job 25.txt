[25:2] Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places.
[25:3] Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?
[25:4] How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
[25:5] Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight:
[25:6] How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!

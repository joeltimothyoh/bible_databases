[107:1] O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever.
[107:2] Let the redeemed of Jehovah say `so', Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
[107:3] And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.
[107:4] They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.
[107:5] Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.
[107:6] Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,
[107:7] He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.
[107:8] Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:9] For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
[107:10] Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,
[107:11] Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
[107:12] Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.
[107:13] Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.
[107:14] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.
[107:15] Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:16] For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
[107:17] Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
[107:18] Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.
[107:19] Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.
[107:20] He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth `them' from their destructions.
[107:21] Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:22] And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.
[107:23] They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;
[107:24] These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.
[107:25] For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
[107:26] They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
[107:27] They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end.
[107:28] Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
[107:29] He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.
[107:30] Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
[107:31] Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:32] Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.
[107:33] He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
[107:34] A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
[107:35] He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.
[107:36] And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,
[107:37] And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.
[107:38] He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
[107:39] Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
[107:40] He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
[107:41] Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh `him' families like a flock.
[107:42] The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
[107:43] Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah. Psalm 108 A Song, A Psalm of David.

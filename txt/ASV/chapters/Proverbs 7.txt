[7:1] My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.
[7:2] Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.
[7:3] Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
[7:4] Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding `thy' kinswoman:
[7:5] That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.
[7:6] For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;
[7:7] And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,
[7:8] Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,
[7:9] In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
[7:10] And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
[7:11] She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:
[7:12] Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.
[7:13] So she caught him, and kissed him, `And' with an impudent face she said unto him:
[7:14] Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.
[7:15] Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
[7:16] I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
[7:17] I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
[7:18] Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.
[7:19] For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:
[7:20] He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.
[7:21] With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.
[7:22] He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as `one in' fetters to the correction of the fool;
[7:23] Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.
[7:24] Now therefore, `my' sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.
[7:25] Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.
[7:26] For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.
[7:27] Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.

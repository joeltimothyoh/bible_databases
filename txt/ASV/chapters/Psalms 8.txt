[8:1] O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!
[8:2] Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
[8:3] When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
[8:4] What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
[8:5] For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.
[8:6] Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:
[8:7] All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,
[8:8] The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
[8:9] O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth! Psalm 9 For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.

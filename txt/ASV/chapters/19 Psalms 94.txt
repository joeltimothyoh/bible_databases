[94:1] O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
[94:2] Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud `their' desert.
[94:3] Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?
[94:4] They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
[94:5] They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage.
[94:6] They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless.
[94:7] And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider.
[94:8] Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
[94:9] He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
[94:10] He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, `Even' he that teacheth man knowledge?
[94:11] Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.
[94:12] Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;
[94:13] That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
[94:14] For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
[94:15] For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
[94:16] Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
[94:17] Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
[94:18] When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.
[94:19] In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
[94:20] Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?
[94:21] They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.
[94:22] But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.
[94:23] And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.

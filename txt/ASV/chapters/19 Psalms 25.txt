[25:1] Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.
[25:2] O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
[25:3] Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause.
[25:4] Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy paths.
[25:5] Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day.
[25:6] Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old.
[25:7] Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.
[25:8] Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.
[25:9] The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way.
[25:10] All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
[25:11] For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
[25:12] What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.
[25:13] His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land.
[25:14] The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant.
[25:15] Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For he will pluck my feet out of the net.
[25:16] Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; For I am desolate and afflicted.
[25:17] The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.
[25:18] Consider mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins.
[25:19] Consider mine enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred.
[25:20] Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
[25:21] Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for thee.
[25:22] Redeem Israel, O God, Out all of his troubles. Psalm 26 `A Psalm' of David.

[122:1] I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah.
[122:2] Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem,
[122:3] Jerusalem, that art builded As a city that is compact together;
[122:4] Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, `For' an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.
[122:5] For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
[122:6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee.
[122:7] Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces.
[122:8] For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
[122:9] For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good. Psalm 123 A Song of Ascents.

[3:1] And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.
[3:2] I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able `to bear it': nay, not even now are ye able;
[3:3] for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?
[3:4] For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?
[3:5] What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.
[3:6] I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
[3:7] So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
[3:8] Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
[3:9] For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are God's husbandry, God's building.
[3:10] According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.
[3:11] For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[3:12] But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
[3:13] each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is.
[3:14] If any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.
[3:15] If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
[3:16] Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and `that' the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
[3:17] If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
[3:18] Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
[3:19] For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:
[3:20] and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.
[3:21] Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
[3:22] whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
[3:23] and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

[149:1] Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints.
[149:2] Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
[149:3] Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp.
[149:4] For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation.
[149:5] Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
[149:6] `Let' the high praises of God `be' in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;
[149:7] To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples;
[149:8] To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
[149:9] To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.

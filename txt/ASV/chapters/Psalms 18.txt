[18:1] I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.
[18:2] Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
[18:3] I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
[18:4] The cords of death compassed me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
[18:5] The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.
[18:6] In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.
[18:7] Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.
[18:8] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.
[18:9] He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.
[18:10] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.
[18:11] He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
[18:12] At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.
[18:13] Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.
[18:14] And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.
[18:15] Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
[18:16] He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.
[18:17] He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
[18:18] They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.
[18:19] He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
[18:20] Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
[18:21] For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
[18:22] For all his ordinances were before me, And I put not away his statutes from me.
[18:23] I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
[18:24] Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
[18:25] With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
[18:26] With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.
[18:27] For thou wilt save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.
[18:28] For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.
[18:29] For by thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I leap over a wall.
[18:30] As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.
[18:31] For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,
[18:32] The God that girdeth me with strength, And maketh my way perfect?
[18:33] He maketh my feet like hinds' `feet': And setteth me upon my high places.
[18:34] He teacheth my hands to war; So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
[18:35] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great.
[18:36] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.
[18:37] I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.
[18:38] I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise: They shall fall under my feet.
[18:39] For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
[18:40] Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.
[18:41] They cried, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.
[18:42] Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
[18:43] Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
[18:44] As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.
[18:45] The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.
[18:46] Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,
[18:47] Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me.
[18:48] He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
[18:49] Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.
[18:50] Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore. Psalm 19 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.

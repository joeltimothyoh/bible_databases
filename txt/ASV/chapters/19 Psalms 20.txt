[20:1] Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;
[20:2] Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion;
[20:3] Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah
[20:4] Grant thee thy heart's desire, And fulfil all thy counsel.
[20:5] We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions.
[20:6] Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand.
[20:7] Some `trust' in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.
[20:8] They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright.
[20:9] Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call. Psalm 21 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.

[9:1] And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.
[9:2] And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
[9:3] Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
[9:4] We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
[9:5] When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
[9:6] When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,
[9:7] and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
[9:8] The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
[9:9] Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am `he'.
[9:10] They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?
[9:11] He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.
[9:12] And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.
[9:13] They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
[9:14] Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
[9:15] Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.
[9:16] Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them.
[9:17] They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
[9:18] The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
[9:19] and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
[9:20] His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
[9:21] but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.
[9:22] These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him `to be' Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
[9:23] Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
[9:24] So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.
[9:25] He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
[9:26] They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?
[9:27] He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?
[9:28] And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
[9:29] We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
[9:30] The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and `yet' he opened mine eyes.
[9:31] We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.
[9:32] Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.
[9:33] If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
[9:34] They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
[9:35] Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
[9:36] He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?
[9:37] Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.
[9:38] And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
[9:39] And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.
[9:40] Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?
[9:41] Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.

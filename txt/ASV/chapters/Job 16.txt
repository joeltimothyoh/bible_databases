[16:1] Then Job answered and said,
[16:2] I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.
[16:3] Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
[16:4] I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.
[16:5] `But' I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage `your grief'.
[16:6] Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?
[16:7] But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.
[16:8] And thou hast laid fast hold on me, `which' is a witness `against me': And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.
[16:9] He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
[16:10] They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.
[16:11] God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
[16:12] I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.
[16:13] His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
[16:14] He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.
[16:15] I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.
[16:16] My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
[16:17] Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.
[16:18] O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no `resting' -place.
[16:19] Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.
[16:20] My friends scoff at me: `But' mine eye poureth out tears unto God,
[16:21] That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!
[16:22] For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.

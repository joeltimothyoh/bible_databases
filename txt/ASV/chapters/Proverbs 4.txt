[4:1] Hear, `my' sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:
[4:2] For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law.
[4:3] For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
[4:4] And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;
[4:5] Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
[4:6] Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee.
[4:7] Wisdom `is' the principal thing; `therefore' get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.
[4:8] Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.
[4:9] She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.
[4:10] Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many.
[4:11] I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.
[4:12] When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
[4:13] Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life.
[4:14] Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men.
[4:15] Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.
[4:16] For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
[4:17] For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.
[4:18] But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
[4:19] The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble.
[4:20] My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
[4:21] Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
[4:22] For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh.
[4:23] Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.
[4:24] Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee.
[4:25] Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
[4:26] Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established.
[4:27] Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil.

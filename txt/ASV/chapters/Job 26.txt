[26:1] Then Job answered and said,
[26:2] How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
[26:3] How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
[26:4] To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?
[26:5] They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
[26:6] Sheol is naked before `God', And Abaddon hath no covering.
[26:7] He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
[26:8] He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.
[26:9] He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
[26:10] He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.
[26:11] The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke.
[26:12] He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
[26:13] By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.
[26:14] Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?

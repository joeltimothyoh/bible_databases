[34:1] Moreover Elihu answered and said,
[34:2] Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
[34:3] For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.
[34:4] Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.
[34:5] For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:
[34:6] Notwithstanding my right I am `accounted' a liar; My wound is incurable, `though I am' without transgression.
[34:7] What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,
[34:8] Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?
[34:9] For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.
[34:10] Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
[34:11] For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.
[34:12] Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
[34:13] Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?
[34:14] If he set his heart upon himself, `If' he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
[34:15] All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.
[34:16] If now `thou hast' understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.
[34:17] Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous `and' mighty?-
[34:18] `Him' that saith to a king, `Thou art' vile, `Or' to nobles, `Ye are' wicked;
[34:19] That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.
[34:20] In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.
[34:21] For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.
[34:22] There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
[34:23] For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.
[34:24] He breaketh in pieces mighty men `in ways' past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.
[34:25] Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
[34:26] He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;
[34:27] Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:
[34:28] So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
[34:29] When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether `it be done' unto a nation, or unto a man:
[34:30] That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.
[34:31] For hath any said unto God, I have borne `chastisement', I will not offend `any more':
[34:32] That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
[34:33] Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.
[34:34] Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
[34:35] Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.
[34:36] Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.
[34:37] For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.

[12:1] Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
[12:2] So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
[12:3] Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
[12:4] But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,
[12:5] Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?
[12:6] Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.
[12:7] Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.
[12:8] For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
[12:9] The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
[12:10] But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;
[12:11] because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
[12:12] On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
[12:13] took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed `is' he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.
[12:14] And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
[12:15] Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
[12:16] These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
[12:17] The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.
[12:18] For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.
[12:19] The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.
[12:20] Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:
[12:21] these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
[12:22] Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.
[12:23] And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
[12:24] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.
[12:25] He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
[12:26] If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.
[12:27] Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.
[12:28] Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, `saying', I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
[12:29] The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
[12:30] Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
[12:31] Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[12:32] And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.
[12:33] But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
[12:34] The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
[12:35] Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
[12:36] While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.
[12:37] But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:
[12:38] that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
[12:39] For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
[12:40] He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.
[12:41] These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.
[12:42] Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess `it', lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
[12:43] for they loved the glory `that is' of men more than the glory `that is' of God.
[12:44] And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
[12:45] And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.
[12:46] I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.
[12:47] And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
[12:48] He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.
[12:49] For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
[12:50] And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.

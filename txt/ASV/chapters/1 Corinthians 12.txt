[12:1] Now concerning spiritual `gifts', brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[12:2] Ye know that when ye were Gentiles `ye were' led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.
[12:3] Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.
[12:4] Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
[12:5] And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.
[12:6] And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.
[12:7] But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
[12:8] For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:
[12:9] to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;
[12:10] and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another `divers' kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:
[12:11] but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
[12:12] For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
[12:13] For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.
[12:14] For the body is not one member, but many.
[12:15] If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
[12:16] And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
[12:17] If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
[12:18] But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.
[12:19] And if they were all one member, where were the body?
[12:20] But now they are many members, but one body.
[12:21] And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
[12:22] Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:
[12:23] and those `parts' of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely `parts' have more abundant comeliness;
[12:24] whereas our comely `parts' have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that `part' which lacked;
[12:25] that there should be no schism in the body; but `that' the members should have the same care one for another.
[12:26] And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or `one' member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
[12:27] Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.
[12:28] And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, `divers' kinds of tongues.
[12:29] Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all `workers of' miracles?
[12:30] have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
[12:31] But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.

[120:1] In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me.
[120:2] Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, `And' from a deceitful tongue.
[120:3] What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?
[120:4] Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper.
[120:5] Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
[120:6] My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace.
[120:7] I am `for' peace: But when I speak, they are for war. Psalm 121 A Song of Ascents.

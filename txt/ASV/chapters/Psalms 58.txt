[58:1] Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
[58:2] Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
[58:3] The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
[58:4] Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: `They are' like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
[58:5] Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely.
[58:6] Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.
[58:7] Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
[58:8] `Let them be' as a snail which melteth and passeth away, `Like' the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun.
[58:9] Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
[58:10] The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
[58:11] So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth. Psalm 59 For the Chief Musician; `set to' Al-tashheth. `A Psalm' of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.

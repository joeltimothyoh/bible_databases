[20:1] And God spake all these words, saying,
[20:2] I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
[20:3] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[20:4] Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness `of any thing' that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
[20:5] Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
[20:6] and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
[20:7] Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
[20:8] Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
[20:9] Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
[20:10] but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: `in it' thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
[20:11] for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
[20:12] Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
[20:13] Thou shalt not kill.
[20:14] Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[20:15] Thou shalt not steal.
[20:16] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
[20:17] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
[20:18] And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
[20:19] And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
[20:20] And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
[20:21] And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
[20:22] And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
[20:23] Ye shall not make `other gods' with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.
[20:24] An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
[20:25] And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
[20:26] Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.

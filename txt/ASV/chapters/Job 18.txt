[18:1] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
[18:2] How long will ye hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
[18:3] Wherefore are we counted as beasts, `And' are become unclean in your sight?
[18:4] Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
[18:5] Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
[18:6] The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out.
[18:7] The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.
[18:8] For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.
[18:9] A gin shall take `him' by the heel, `And' a snare shall lay hold on him.
[18:10] A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.
[18:11] Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, And shall chase him at his heels.
[18:12] His strength shall be hunger-bitten, And calamity shall be ready at his side.
[18:13] The members of his body shall be devoured, `Yea', the first-born of death shall devour his members.
[18:14] He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
[18:15] There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
[18:16] His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off.
[18:17] His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street.
[18:18] He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.
[18:19] He shall have neither son nor son's son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned.
[18:20] They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted.
[18:21] Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.

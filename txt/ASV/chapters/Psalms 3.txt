[3:1] Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.
[3:2] Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah
[3:3] But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.
[3:4] I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah
[3:5] I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.
[3:6] I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.
[3:7] Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
[3:8] Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah Psalm 4 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.

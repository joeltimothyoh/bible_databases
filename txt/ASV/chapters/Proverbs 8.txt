[8:1] Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?
[8:2] On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;
[8:3] Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
[8:4] Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men.
[8:5] O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.
[8:6] Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
[8:7] For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
[8:8] All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
[8:9] They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.
[8:10] Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.
[8:11] For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.
[8:12] I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge `and' discretion.
[8:13] The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.
[8:14] Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.
[8:15] By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.
[8:16] By me princes rule, And nobles, `even' all the judges of the earth.
[8:17] I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.
[8:18] Riches and honor are with me; `Yea', durable wealth and righteousness.
[8:19] My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.
[8:20] I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;
[8:21] That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.
[8:22] Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.
[8:23] I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.
[8:24] When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.
[8:25] Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;
[8:26] While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
[8:27] When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,
[8:28] When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,
[8:29] When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;
[8:30] Then I was by him, `as' a master workman; And I was daily `his' delight, Rejoicing always before him,
[8:31] Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.
[8:32] Now therefore, `my' sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.
[8:33] Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.
[8:34] Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.
[8:35] For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.
[8:36] But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.

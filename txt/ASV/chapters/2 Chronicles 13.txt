[13:1] In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
[13:2] Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
[13:3] And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.
[13:4] And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:
[13:5] Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
[13:6] Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.
[13:7] And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
[13:8] And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.
[13:9] Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of `other' lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of `them that are' no gods.
[13:10] But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and `we have' priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:
[13:11] and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also `set they' in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.
[13:12] And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
[13:13] But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
[13:14] And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
[13:15] Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
[13:16] And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.
[13:17] And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
[13:18] Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
[13:19] And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.
[13:20] Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.
[13:21] But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
[13:22] And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.

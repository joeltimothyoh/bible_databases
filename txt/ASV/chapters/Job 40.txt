[40:1] Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,
[40:2] Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.
[40:3] Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,
[40:4] Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.
[40:5] Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.
[40:6] Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
[40:7] Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
[40:8] Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?
[40:9] Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
[40:10] Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty.
[40:11] Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.
[40:12] Look on every one that is proud, `and' bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand.
[40:13] Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden `place'.
[40:14] Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee.
[40:15] Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox.
[40:16] Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly.
[40:17] He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
[40:18] His bones are `as' tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron.
[40:19] He is the chief of the ways of God: He `only' that made him giveth him his sword.
[40:20] Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play.
[40:21] He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen.
[40:22] The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about.
[40:23] Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.
[40:24] Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?

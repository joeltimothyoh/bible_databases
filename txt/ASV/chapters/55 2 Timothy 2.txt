[2:1] Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[2:2] And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
[2:3] Suffer hardship with `me', as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[2:4] No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of `this' life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
[2:5] And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.
[2:6] The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
[2:7] Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
[2:8] Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:
[2:9] wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
[2:10] Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
[2:11] Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:
[2:12] if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:
[2:13] if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
[2:14] Of these things put them in remembrance, charging `them' in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
[2:15] Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.
[2:16] But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
[2:17] and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;
[2:18] men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
[2:19] Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
[2:20] Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
[2:21] If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared unto every good work.
[2:22] after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
[2:23] But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
[2:24] And the Lord's servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,
[2:25] in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,
[2:26] and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.

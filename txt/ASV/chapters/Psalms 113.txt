[113:1] Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah.
[113:2] Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.
[113:3] From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Jehovah's name is to be praised.
[113:4] Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens.
[113:5] Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high,
[113:6] That humbleth himself to behold `The things that are' in heaven and in the earth?
[113:7] He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;
[113:8] That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.
[113:9] He maketh the barren woman to keep house, `And to be' a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.

[130:1] Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah.
[130:2] Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
[130:3] If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
[130:4] But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared.
[130:5] I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope.
[130:6] My soul `waiteth' for the Lord More than watchmen `wait' for the morning; `Yea, more than' watchmen for the morning.
[130:7] O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption.
[130:8] And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities. Psalm 131 A Song of Ascents; of David.

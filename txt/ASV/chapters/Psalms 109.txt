[109:1] Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
[109:2] For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
[109:3] They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.
[109:4] For my love they are my adversaries: But I `give myself unto' prayer.
[109:5] And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
[109:6] Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
[109:7] When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.
[109:8] Let his days be few; `And' let another take his office.
[109:9] Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.
[109:10] Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek `their bread' out of their desolate places.
[109:11] Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.
[109:12] Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
[109:13] Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
[109:14] Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
[109:15] Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
[109:16] Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay `them'.
[109:17] Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
[109:18] He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.
[109:19] Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
[109:20] This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.
[109:21] But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name's sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;
[109:22] For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.
[109:23] I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
[109:24] My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.
[109:25] I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.
[109:26] Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:
[109:27] That they may know that this is thy hand; `That' thou, Jehovah, hast done it.
[109:28] Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.
[109:29] Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
[109:30] I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
[109:31] For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul. Psalm 110 A Psalm of David.

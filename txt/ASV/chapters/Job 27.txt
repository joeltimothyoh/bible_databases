[27:1] And Job again took up his parable, and said,
[27:2] As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:
[27:3] (For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
[27:4] Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
[27:5] Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
[27:6] My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach `me' so long as I live.
[27:7] Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
[27:8] For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?
[27:9] Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?
[27:10] Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?
[27:11] I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
[27:12] Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?
[27:13] This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:
[27:14] If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
[27:15] Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.
[27:16] Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;
[27:17] He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.
[27:18] He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
[27:19] He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered `to his fathers'; He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
[27:20] Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
[27:21] The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.
[27:22] For `God' shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.
[27:23] Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.

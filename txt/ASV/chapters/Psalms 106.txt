[106:1] Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' forever.
[106:2] Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?
[106:3] Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
[106:4] Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,
[106:5] That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.
[106:6] We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
[106:7] Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
[106:8] Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.
[106:9] He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
[106:10] And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
[106:11] And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.
[106:12] Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.
[106:13] They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,
[106:14] But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.
[106:15] And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.
[106:16] They envied Moses also in the camp, `And' Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
[106:17] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.
[106:18] And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.
[106:19] They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.
[106:20] Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
[106:21] They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,
[106:22] Wondrous works in the land of Ham, `And' terrible things by the Red Sea.
[106:23] Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy `them'.
[106:24] Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,
[106:25] But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
[106:26] Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
[106:27] And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.
[106:28] They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
[106:29] Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.
[106:30] Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.
[106:31] And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.
[106:32] They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
[106:33] Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
[106:34] They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,
[106:35] But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,
[106:36] And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.
[106:37] Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
[106:38] And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.
[106:39] Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.
[106:40] Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.
[106:41] And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.
[106:42] Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
[106:43] Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.
[106:44] Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:
[106:45] And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
[106:46] He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.
[106:47] Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.
[106:48] Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.

[37:1] Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.
[37:2] Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
[37:3] He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightening unto the ends of the earth.
[37:4] After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not `the lightnings' when his voice is heard.
[37:5] God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
[37:6] For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.
[37:7] He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know `it'.
[37:8] Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.
[37:9] Out of the chamber `of the south' cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.
[37:10] By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
[37:11] Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
[37:12] And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,
[37:13] Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.
[37:14] Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
[37:15] Dost thou know how God layeth `his charge' upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?
[37:16] Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
[37:17] How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south `wind'?
[37:18] Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?
[37:19] Teach us what we shall say unto him; `For' we cannot set `our speech' in order by reason of darkness.
[37:20] Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
[37:21] And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.
[37:22] Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.
[37:23] `Touching' the Almighty, we cannot find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
[37:24] Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.

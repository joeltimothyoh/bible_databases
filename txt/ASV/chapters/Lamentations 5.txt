[5:1] Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach.
[5:2] Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens.
[5:3] We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows.
[5:4] We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us.
[5:5] Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest.
[5:6] We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
[5:7] Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities.
[5:8] Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand.
[5:9] We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness.
[5:10] Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.
[5:11] They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.
[5:12] Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored.
[5:13] The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood.
[5:14] The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music.
[5:15] The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning.
[5:16] The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned.
[5:17] For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim;
[5:18] For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it.
[5:19] Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation.
[5:20] Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, `And' forsake us so long time?
[5:21] Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.
[5:22] But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us.

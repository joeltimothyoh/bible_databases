[17:1] My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is `ready' for me.
[17:2] Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.
[17:3] Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?
[17:4] For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt `them'.
[17:5] He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
[17:6] But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.
[17:7] Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.
[17:8] Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
[17:9] Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.
[17:10] But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you.
[17:11] My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.
[17:12] They change the night into day: The light, `say they', is near unto the darkness.
[17:13] If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
[17:14] If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, `Thou art' my mother, and my sister;
[17:15] Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?
[17:16] It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust.

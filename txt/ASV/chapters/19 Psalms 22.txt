[22:1] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? `Why art thou so' far from helping me, `and from' the words of my groaning?
[22:2] O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent.
[22:3] But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
[22:4] Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
[22:5] They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.
[22:6] But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people.
[22:7] All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, `saying',
[22:8] Commit `thyself' unto Jehovah; Let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.
[22:9] But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust `when I was' upon my mother's breasts.
[22:10] I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me.
[22:11] Be not far from me; for trouble is near; For there is none to help.
[22:12] Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
[22:13] They gape upon me with their mouth, `As' a ravening and a roaring lion.
[22:14] I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.
[22:15] My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
[22:16] For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.
[22:17] I may count all my bones; They look and stare upon me.
[22:18] They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots.
[22:19] But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me.
[22:20] Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog.
[22:21] Save me from the lion's mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.
[22:22] I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.
[22:23] Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.
[22:24] For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard.
[22:25] Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
[22:26] The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever.
[22:27] All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
[22:28] For the kingdom is Jehovah's; And he is the ruler over the nations.
[22:29] All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.
[22:30] A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the `next' generation.
[22:31] They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it. Psalm 23 A Psalm of David.

[104:1] Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
[104:2] Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
[104:3] Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
[104:4] Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;
[104:5] Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever.
[104:6] Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.
[104:7] At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
[104:8] (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
[104:9] Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.
[104:10] He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;
[104:11] They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.
[104:12] By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.
[104:13] He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
[104:14] He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
[104:15] And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, `And' oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.
[104:16] The trees of Jehovah are filled `with moisture', The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
[104:17] Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
[104:18] The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
[104:19] He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.
[104:20] Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
[104:21] The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.
[104:22] The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.
[104:23] Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.
[104:24] O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches.
[104:25] Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.
[104:26] There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.
[104:27] These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season.
[104:28] Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
[104:29] Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.
[104:30] Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.
[104:31] Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:
[104:32] Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
[104:33] I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
[104:34] Let thy meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.
[104:35] Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.

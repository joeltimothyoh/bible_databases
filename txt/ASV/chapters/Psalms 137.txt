[137:1] By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion.
[137:2] Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps.
[137:3] For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us `required of us' mirth, `saying', Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
[137:4] How shall we sing Jehovah's song In a foreign land?
[137:5] If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget `her skill'.
[137:6] Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy.
[137:7] Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof.
[137:8] O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us.
[137:9] Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock. Psalm 138 A `Psalm' of David.

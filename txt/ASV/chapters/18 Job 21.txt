[21:1] Then Job answered and said,
[21:2] Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.
[21:3] Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.
[21:4] As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?
[21:5] Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.
[21:6] Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh.
[21:7] Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
[21:8] Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.
[21:9] Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.
[21:10] Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
[21:11] They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.
[21:12] They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
[21:13] They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
[21:14] And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
[21:15] What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
[21:16] Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
[21:17] How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That `God' distributeth sorrows in his anger?
[21:18] That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?
[21:19] `Ye say', God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:
[21:20] Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
[21:21] For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?
[21:22] Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high?
[21:23] One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:
[21:24] His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
[21:25] And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good.
[21:26] They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.
[21:27] Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.
[21:28] For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
[21:29] Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,
[21:30] That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
[21:31] Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?
[21:32] Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb.
[21:33] The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.
[21:34] How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth `only' falsehood?

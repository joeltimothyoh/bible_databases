[148:1] Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: Praise him in the heights.
[148:2] Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his host.
[148:3] Praise ye him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light.
[148:4] Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.
[148:5] Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created.
[148:6] He hath also established them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass away.
[148:7] Praise Jehovah from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps.
[148:8] Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;
[148:9] Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars;
[148:10] Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds;
[148:11] Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;
[148:12] Both young men and virgins; Old men and children:
[148:13] Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
[148:14] And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.

[2:1] Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judges another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.
[2:2] And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.
[2:3] And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
[2:4] Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
[2:5] but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
[2:6] who will render to every man according to his works:
[2:7] to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:
[2:8] but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, `shall be' wrath and indignation,
[2:9] tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;
[2:10] but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:
[2:11] for there is no respect of persons with God.
[2:12] For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
[2:13] for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:
[2:14] (for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;
[2:15] in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing `them');
[2:16] in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.
[2:17] But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,
[2:18] and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
[2:19] and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,
[2:20] a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;
[2:21] thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
[2:22] thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?
[2:23] thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?
[2:24] For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.
[2:25] For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.
[2:26] If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?
[2:27] and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?
[2:28] For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
[2:29] but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.

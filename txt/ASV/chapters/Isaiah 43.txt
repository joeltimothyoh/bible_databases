[43:1] But now thus saith Jehovah that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.
[43:2] When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
[43:3] For I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.
[43:4] Since thou hast been precious in my sight, `and' honorable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.
[43:5] Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
[43:6] I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;
[43:7] every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.
[43:8] Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
[43:9] Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
[43:10] Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
[43:11] I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.
[43:12] I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange `god' among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.
[43:13] Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it?
[43:14] Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.
[43:15] I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
[43:16] Thus saith Jehovah, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
[43:17] who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick):
[43:18] Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
[43:19] Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
[43:20] The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
[43:21] the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.
[43:22] Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
[43:23] Thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.
[43:24] Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
[43:25] I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.
[43:26] Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth `thy cause', that thou mayest be justified.
[43:27] Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
[43:28] Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.

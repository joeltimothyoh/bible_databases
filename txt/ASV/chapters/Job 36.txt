[36:1] Elihu also proceeded, and said,
[36:2] Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf.
[36:3] I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
[36:4] For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
[36:5] Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.
[36:6] He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted `their' right.
[36:7] He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.
[36:8] And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions;
[36:9] Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
[36:10] He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
[36:11] If they hearken and serve `him', They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.
[36:12] But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.
[36:13] But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
[36:14] They die in youth, And their life `perisheth' among the unclean.
[36:15] He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.
[36:16] Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.
[36:17] But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold `on thee'.
[36:18] For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
[36:19] Will thy cry avail, `that thou be' not in distress, Or all the forces of `thy' strength?
[36:20] Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.
[36:21] Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
[36:22] Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?
[36:23] Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?
[36:24] Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.
[36:25] All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.
[36:26] Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.
[36:27] For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,
[36:28] Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.
[36:29] Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?
[36:30] Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.
[36:31] For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.
[36:32] He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
[36:33] The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning `the storm' that cometh up.

[8:1] but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
[8:2] And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
[8:3] And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
[8:4] they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.
[8:5] Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?
[8:6] And this they said, trying him, that they might have `whereof' to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
[8:7] But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
[8:8] And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
[8:9] And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, `even' unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
[8:10] And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
[8:11] And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.
[8:12] Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[8:13] The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
[8:14] Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.
[8:15] Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
[8:16] Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
[8:17] Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.
[8:18] I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
[8:19] They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
[8:20] These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
[8:21] He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.
[8:22] The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?
[8:23] And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
[8:24] I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am `he', ye shall die in your sins.
[8:25] They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.
[8:26] I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.
[8:27] They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.
[8:28] Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am `he', and `that' I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
[8:29] And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
[8:30] As he spake these things, many believed on him.
[8:31] Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, `then' are ye truly my disciples;
[8:32] and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
[8:33] They answered unto him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
[8:34] Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
[8:35] And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.
[8:36] If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
[8:37] I know that ye are Abraham's seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.
[8:38] I speak the things which I have seen with `my' Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from `your' father.
[8:39] They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
[8:40] But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
[8:41] Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, `even' God.
[8:42] Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
[8:43] Why do ye not understand my speech? `Even' because ye cannot hear my word.
[8:44] Ye are of `your' father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
[8:45] But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
[8:46] Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?
[8:47] He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear `them' not, because ye are not of God.
[8:48] The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
[8:49] Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
[8:50] But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
[8:51] Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.
[8:52] The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
[8:53] Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
[8:54] Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;
[8:55] and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.
[8:56] Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
[8:57] The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
[8:58] Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
[8:59] They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.

[3:1] But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
[3:2] For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
[3:3] without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
[3:4] traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
[3:5] holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.
[3:6] For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
[3:7] ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[3:8] And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
[3:9] But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.
[3:10] But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
[3:11] persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.
[3:12] Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[3:13] But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[3:14] But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.
[3:15] And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[3:16] Every scripture inspired of God `is' also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.
[3:17] That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.

[145:1] I will extol thee, my God, O King; And I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
[145:2] Every day will I bless thee; And I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
[145:3] Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; And his greatness is unsearchable.
[145:4] One generation shall laud thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty acts.
[145:5] Of the glorious majesty of thine honor, And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate.
[145:6] And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; And I will declare thy greatness.
[145:7] They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, And shall sing of thy righteousness.
[145:8] Jehovah is gracious, and merciful; Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness.
[145:9] Jehovah is good to all; And his tender mercies are over all his works.
[145:10] All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; And thy saints shall bless thee.
[145:11] They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, And talk of thy power;
[145:12] To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
[145:13] Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And thy dominion `endureth' throughout all generations.
[145:14] Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that are bowed down.
[145:15] The eyes of all wait for thee; And thou givest them their food in due season.
[145:16] Thou openest thy hand, And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
[145:17] Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, And gracious in all his works.
[145:18] Jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth.
[145:19] He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; He also will hear their cry and will save them.
[145:20] Jehovah preserveth all them that love him; But all the wicked will he destroy.
[145:21] My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.

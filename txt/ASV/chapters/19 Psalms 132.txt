[132:1] Jehovah, remember for David All his affliction;
[132:2] How he sware unto Jehovah, And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
[132:3] Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, Nor go up into my bed;
[132:4] I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Or slumber to mine eyelids;
[132:5] Until I find out a place for Jehovah, A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
[132:6] Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: We found it in the field of the wood.
[132:7] We will go into his tabernacles; We will worship at his footstool.
[132:8] Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
[132:9] Let thy priest be clothed with righteousness; And let thy saints shout for joy.
[132:10] For thy servant David's sake Turn not away the face of thine anointed.
[132:11] Jehovah hath sworn unto David in truth; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
[132:12] If thy children will keep my covenant And my testimony that I shall teach them, Their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
[132:13] For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for his habitation.
[132:14] This is my resting-place for ever: Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
[132:15] I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
[132:16] Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
[132:17] There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
[132:18] His enemies will I clothe with shame; But upon himself shall his crown flourish. Psalm 133 A Song of Ascents; of David.

[41:1] Blessed is he that considereth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.
[41:2] Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, And he shall be blessed upon the earth; And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies.
[41:3] Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing: Thou makest all his bed in his sickness.
[41:4] I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me: Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
[41:5] Mine enemies speak evil against me, `saying', When will he die, and his name perish?
[41:6] And if he come to see `me', he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: When he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
[41:7] All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise my hurt.
[41:8] An evil disease, `say they', cleaveth fast unto him; And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
[41:9] Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me.
[41:10] But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, That I may requite them.
[41:11] By this I know that thou delightest in me, Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
[41:12] And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, And settest me before thy face for ever.
[41:13] Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. Psalm 42 For the Chief Musician. Maschil of the sons of Korah.

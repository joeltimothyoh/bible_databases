[85:1] Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
[85:2] Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah
[85:3] Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned `thyself' from the fierceness of thine anger.
[85:4] Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
[85:5] Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
[85:6] Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?
[85:7] Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation.
[85:8] I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly.
[85:9] Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.
[85:10] Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
[85:11] Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
[85:12] Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase.
[85:13] Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way `to walk in'.

[2:1] I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;
[2:2] for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.
[2:3] This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
[2:4] who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
[2:5] For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, `himself' man, Christ Jesus,
[2:6] who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony `to be borne' in its own times;
[2:7] whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
[2:8] I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
[2:9] In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;
[2:10] but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.
[2:11] Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
[2:12] But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.
[2:13] For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
[2:14] and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:
[2:15] but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.

[21:3] And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs.
[21:4] And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

[21:17] And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
[21:18] Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
[21:19] All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
[21:20] And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

[21:26] All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
[21:27] And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh `they gave' Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.

[21:41] All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
[21:42] These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
[21:43] So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
[21:44] And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.
[21:45] There failed not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

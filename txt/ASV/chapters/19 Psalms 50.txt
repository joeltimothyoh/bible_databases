[50:1] The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
[50:2] Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.
[50:3] Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him.
[50:4] He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people:
[50:5] Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
[50:6] And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. Selah
[50:7] Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, `even' thy God.
[50:8] I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.
[50:9] I will take no bullock out of thy house, Nor he-goats out of thy folds.
[50:10] For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle upon a thousand hills.
[50:11] I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.
[50:12] If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
[50:13] Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?
[50:14] Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High:
[50:15] And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
[50:16] But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth,
[50:17] Seeing thou hatest instruction, And castest my words behind thee?
[50:18] When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers.
[50:19] Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit.
[50:20] Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
[50:21] These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: `But' I will reprove thee, and set `them' in order before thine eyes.
[50:22] Now consider this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:
[50:23] Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way `aright' Will I show the salvation of God. Psalm 51 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

[108:1] My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
[108:2] Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
[108:3] I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
[108:4] For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth `reacheth' unto the skies.
[108:5] Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.
[108:6] That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
[108:7] God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
[108:8] Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
[108:9] Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.
[108:10] Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
[108:11] Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
[108:12] Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
[108:13] Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries. Psalm 109 For the Chief Musicion. A Psalm of David.

[116:1] I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications.
[116:2] Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call `upon him' as long as I live.
[116:3] The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
[116:4] Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
[116:5] Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful.
[116:6] Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.
[116:7] Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.
[116:8] For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, `And' my feet from falling.
[116:9] I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living.
[116:10] I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted:
[116:11] I said in my haste, All men are liars.
[116:12] What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me?
[116:13] I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah.
[116:14] I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people.
[116:15] Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints.
[116:16] O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds.
[116:17] I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah.
[116:18] I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people,
[116:19] In the courts of Jehovah's house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

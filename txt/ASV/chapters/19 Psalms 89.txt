[89:1] I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
[89:2] For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.
[89:3] I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant:
[89:4] Thy seed will I establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations. Selah
[89:5] And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
[89:6] For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,
[89:7] A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him?
[89:8] O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.
[89:9] Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
[89:10] Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.
[89:11] The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
[89:12] The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.
[89:13] Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
[89:14] Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.
[89:15] Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.
[89:16] In thy name do they rejoice all the day; And in thy righteousness are they exalted.
[89:17] For thou art the glory of their strength; And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.
[89:18] For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah; And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
[89:19] Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
[89:20] I have found David my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him:
[89:21] With whom my hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
[89:22] The enemy shall not exact from him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
[89:23] And I will beat down his adversaries before him, And smite them that hate him.
[89:24] But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him; And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
[89:25] I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.
[89:26] He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.
[89:27] I also will make him `my' first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth.
[89:28] My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
[89:29] His seed also will I make to endure for ever, And his throne as the days of heaven.
[89:30] If his children forsake my law, And walk not in mine ordinances;
[89:31] If they break my statutes, And keep not my commandments;
[89:32] Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.
[89:33] But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
[89:34] My covenant will I not break, Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
[89:35] Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:
[89:36] His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me.
[89:37] It shall be established for ever as the moon, And `as' the faithful witness in the sky. Selah
[89:38] But thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
[89:39] Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: Thou hast profaned his crown `by casting it' to the ground.
[89:40] Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
[89:41] All that pass by the way rob him: He is become a reproach to his neighbors.
[89:42] Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
[89:43] Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
[89:44] Thou hast made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.
[89:45] The days of his youth hast thou shortened: Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah
[89:46] How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? `How long' shall thy wrath burn like fire?
[89:47] Oh remember how short my time is: For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!
[89:48] What man is he that shall live and not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah
[89:49] Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?
[89:50] Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom `the reproach of' all the mighty peoples,
[89:51] Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
[89:52] Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen, and Amen. Psalm 90 A Prayer of Moses the man of God.

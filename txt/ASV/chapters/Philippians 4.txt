[4:1] Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.
[4:2] I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.
[4:3] Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
[4:4] Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.
[4:5] Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
[4:6] In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
[4:7] And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
[4:8] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
[4:9] The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
[4:10] But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.
[4:11] Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.
[4:12] I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
[4:13] I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.
[4:14] Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.
[4:15] And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;
[4:16] for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.
[4:17] Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.
[4:18] But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things `that came' from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
[4:19] And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[4:20] Now unto our God and Father `be' the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
[4:21] Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.
[4:22] All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household.
[4:23] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

[99:1] Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth `above' the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
[99:2] Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples.
[99:3] Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he.
[99:4] The king's strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.
[99:5] Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he.
[99:6] Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.
[99:7] He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them.
[99:8] Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
[99:9] Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy. Psalm 100 A Psalm of thanksgiving.

[11:1] A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight.
[11:2] When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.
[11:3] The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.
[11:4] Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death.
[11:5] The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
[11:6] The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity.
[11:7] When a wicked man dieth, `his' expectation shall perish; And the hope of iniquity perisheth.
[11:8] The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked cometh in his stead.
[11:9] With his mouth the godless man destroyeth his neighbor; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.
[11:10] When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
[11:11] By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
[11:12] He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
[11:13] He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.
[11:14] Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
[11:15] He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth suretyship is secure.
[11:16] A gracious woman obtaineth honor; And violent men obtain riches.
[11:17] The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
[11:18] The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness `hath' a sure reward.
[11:19] He that is stedfast in righteousness `shall attain' unto life; And he that pursueth evil `doeth it' to his own death.
[11:20] They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to Jehovah; But such as are perfect in `their' way are his delight.
[11:21] `Though' hand `join' in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
[11:22] `As' a ring of gold in a swine's snout, `So is' a fair woman that is without discretion.
[11:23] The desire of the righteous is only good; `But' the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
[11:24] There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but `it tendeth' only to want.
[11:25] The liberal soul shall be made fat; And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
[11:26] He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.
[11:27] He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him.
[11:28] He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.
[11:29] He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
[11:30] The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls.
[11:31] Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: How much more the wicked and the sinner!

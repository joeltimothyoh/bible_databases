[23:1] Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.
[23:2] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters.
[23:3] He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[23:4] Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[23:5] Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over.
[23:6] Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever. Psalm 24 A Psalm of David.

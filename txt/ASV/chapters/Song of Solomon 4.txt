[4:1] Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are `as' doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead.
[4:2] Thy teeth are like a flock `of ewes' that are `newly' shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.
[4:3] Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.
[4:4] Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men.
[4:5] Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.
[4:6] Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.
[4:7] Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.
[4:8] Come with me from Lebanon, `my' bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards.
[4:9] Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, `my' bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.
[4:10] How fair is thy love, my sister, `my' bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!
[4:11] Thy lips, O `my' bride, drop `as' the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
[4:12] A garden shut up is my sister, `my' bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
[4:13] Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,
[4:14] Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
[4:15] `Thou art' a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.
[4:16] Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.

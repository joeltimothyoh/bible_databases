[9:1] Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:
[9:2] She hath killed her beasts; She hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:
[9:3] She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:
[9:4] Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
[9:5] Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
[9:6] Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.
[9:7] He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man `getteth' himself a blot.
[9:8] Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
[9:9] Give `instruction' to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
[9:10] The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
[9:11] For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.
[9:12] If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.
[9:13] The foolish woman is clamorous; `She is' simple, and knoweth nothing.
[9:14] And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,
[9:15] To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:
[9:16] Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
[9:17] Stolen waters are sweet, And bread `eaten' in secret is pleasant.
[9:18] But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

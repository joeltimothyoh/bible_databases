[80:1] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest `above' the cherubim, shine forth.
[80:2] Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, And come to save us.
[80:3] Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
[80:4] O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
[80:5] Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.
[80:6] Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.
[80:7] Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
[80:8] Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
[80:9] Thou preparedst `room' before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.
[80:10] The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were `like' cedars of God.
[80:11] It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.
[80:12] Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
[80:13] The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
[80:14] Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
[80:15] And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
[80:16] It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
[80:17] Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
[80:18] So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.
[80:19] Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. Psalm 81 For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. `A Psalm' of Asaph.

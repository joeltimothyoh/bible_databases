[86:1] Bow down thine ear, O Jehovah, and answer me; For I am poor and needy.
[86:2] Preserve my soul; for I am godly: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
[86:3] Be merciful unto me, O Lord; For unto thee do I cry all the day long.
[86:4] Rejoice the soul of thy servant; For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
[86:5] For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon thee.
[86:6] Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; And hearken unto the voice of my supplications.
[86:7] In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; For thou wilt answer me.
[86:8] There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; Neither `are there any works' like unto thy works.
[86:9] All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify thy name.
[86:10] For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: Thou art God alone.
[86:11] Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name.
[86:12] I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; And I will glorify thy name for evermore.
[86:13] For great is thy lovingkindness toward me; And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
[86:14] O God, the proud are risen up against me, And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, And have not set thee before them.
[86:15] But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
[86:16] Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; Give thy strength unto thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.
[86:17] Show me a token for good, That they who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, Because thou, Jehovah, hast helped me, and comforted me. Psalm 87 A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song.

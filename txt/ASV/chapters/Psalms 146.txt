[146:1] Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
[146:2] While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
[146:3] Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
[146:4] His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.
[146:5] Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God:
[146:6] Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever;
[146:7] Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;
[146:8] Jehovah openeth `the eyes of' the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;
[146:9] Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
[146:10] Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.

[31:1] The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
[31:2] What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?
[31:3] Give not thy strength unto women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
[31:4] It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; Nor for princes `to say', Where is strong drink?
[31:5] Lest they drink, and forget the law, And pervert the justice `due' to any that is afflicted.
[31:6] Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, And wine unto the bitter in soul:
[31:7] Let him drink, and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more.
[31:8] Open thy mouth for the dumb, In the cause of all such as are left desolate.
[31:9] Open thy mouth, judge righteously, And minister justice to the poor and needy.
[31:10] A worthy woman who can find? For her price is far above rubies.
[31:11] The heart of her husband trusteth in her, And he shall have no lack of gain.
[31:12] She doeth him good and not evil All the days of her life.
[31:13] She seeketh wool and flax, And worketh willingly with her hands.
[31:14] She is like the merchant-ships; She bringeth her bread from afar.
[31:15] She riseth also while it is yet night, And giveth food to her household, And their task to her maidens.
[31:16] She considereth a field, and buyeth it; With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
[31:17] She girdeth her loins with strength, And maketh strong her arms.
[31:18] She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: Her lamp goeth not out by night.
[31:19] She layeth her hands to the distaff, And her hands hold the spindle.
[31:20] She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
[31:21] She is not afraid of the snow for her household; For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
[31:22] She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
[31:23] Her husband is known in the gates, When he sitteth among the elders of the land.
[31:24] She maketh linen garments and selleth them, And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
[31:25] Strength and dignity are her clothing; And she laugheth at the time to come.
[31:26] She openeth her mouth with wisdom; And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
[31:27] She looketh well to the ways of her household, And eateth not the bread of idleness.
[31:28] Her children rise up, and call her blessed; Her husband `also', and he praiseth her, `saying':
[31:29] Many daughters have done worthily, But thou excellest them all.
[31:30] Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; `But' a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.
[31:31] Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates.

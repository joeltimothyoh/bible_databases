[27:4] And thou shalt make for it a grating of network of brass: and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof.
[27:5] And thou shalt put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway up the altar.
[27:6] And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with brass.
[27:7] And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in bearing it.

[27:10] and the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets `shall be' of silver.
[27:11] And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, and the pillars thereof twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.
[27:12] And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.
[27:13] And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits.

[27:16] And for the gate of the court shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer; their pillars four, and their sockets four.
[27:17] All the pillars of the court round about shall be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of brass.
[27:18] The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass.
[27:19] All the instruments of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.
[27:20] And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
[27:21] In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah: it shall be a statue for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.

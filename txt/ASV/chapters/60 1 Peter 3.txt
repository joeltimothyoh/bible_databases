[3:1] In like manner, ye wives, `be' in subjection to your won husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;
[3:2] beholding your chaste behavior `coupled' with fear.
[3:3] Whose `adorning' let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;
[3:4] but `let it be' the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible `apparel' of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
[3:5] For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
[3:6] as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
[3:7] Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with `your wives' according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.
[3:8] Finally, `be' ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:
[3:9] not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
[3:10] For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:
[3:11] And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
[3:12] For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.
[3:13] And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?
[3:14] But even if ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed `are ye:' and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;
[3:15] but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: `being' ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:
[3:16] having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.
[3:17] For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
[3:18] Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
[3:19] in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,
[3:20] that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
[3:21] which also after a true likeness doth now save you, `even' baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
[3:22] who is one the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

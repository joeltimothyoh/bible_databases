[28:1] The wicked flee when no man pursueth; But the righteous are bold as a lion.
[28:2] For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by men of understanding `and' knowledge the state `thereof' shall be prolonged.
[28:3] A needy man that oppresseth the poor Is `like' a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
[28:4] They that forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them.
[28:5] Evil men understand not justice; But they that seek Jehovah understand all things.
[28:6] Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, Than he that is perverse in `his' ways, though he be rich.
[28:7] Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son; But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father.
[28:8] He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor.
[28:9] He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.
[28:10] Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, He shall fall himself into his own pit; But the perfect shall inherit good.
[28:11] The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
[28:12] When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
[28:13] He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper: But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.
[28:14] Happy is the man that feareth alway; But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
[28:15] `As' a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, `So is' a wicked ruler over a poor people.
[28:16] The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; `But' he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
[28:17] A man that is laden with the blood of any person Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him.
[28:18] Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered; But he that is perverse in `his' ways shall fall at once.
[28:19] He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain `persons' shall have poverty enough.
[28:20] A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.
[28:21] To have respect of persons is not good; Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread.
[28:22] he that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.
[28:23] He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor Than he that flattereth with the tongue.
[28:24] Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, The same is the companion of a destroyer.
[28:25] He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat.
[28:26] He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
[28:27] He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
[28:28] When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.

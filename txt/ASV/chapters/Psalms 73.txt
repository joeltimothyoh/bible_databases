[73:1] Surely God is good to Israel, `Even' to such as are pure in heart.
[73:2] But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.
[73:3] For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
[73:4] For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.
[73:5] They are not in trouble as `other' men; Neither are they plagued like `other' men.
[73:6] Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.
[73:7] Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.
[73:8] They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.
[73:9] They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.
[73:10] Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full `cup' are drained by them.
[73:11] And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?
[73:12] Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.
[73:13] Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;
[73:14] For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.
[73:15] If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
[73:16] When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;
[73:17] Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.
[73:18] Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.
[73:19] How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.
[73:20] As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
[73:21] For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:
[73:22] So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was `as' a beast before thee.
[73:23] Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.
[73:24] Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.
[73:25] Whom have I in heaven `but thee'? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
[73:26] My flesh and my heart faileth; `But' God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
[73:27] For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, `departing' from thee.
[73:28] But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works. Psalm 74 Maschil of Asaph.

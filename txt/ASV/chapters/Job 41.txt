[41:1] Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?
[41:2] Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
[41:3] Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
[41:4] Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?
[41:5] Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
[41:6] Will the bands `of fishermen' make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?
[41:7] Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?
[41:8] Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.
[41:9] Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
[41:10] None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?
[41:11] Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? `Whatsoever is' under the whole heaven is mine.
[41:12] I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.
[41:13] Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?
[41:14] Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.
[41:15] `His' strong scales are `his' pride, Shut up together `as with' a close seal.
[41:16] One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.
[41:17] They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.
[41:18] His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
[41:19] Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.
[41:20] Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and `burning' rushes.
[41:21] His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.
[41:22] In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him.
[41:23] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
[41:24] His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.
[41:25] When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.
[41:26] If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
[41:27] He counteth iron as straw, `And' brass as rotten wood.
[41:28] The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
[41:29] Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
[41:30] His underparts are `like' sharp potsherds: He spreadeth `as it were' a threshing-wain upon the mire.
[41:31] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
[41:32] He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.
[41:33] Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.
[41:34] He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.

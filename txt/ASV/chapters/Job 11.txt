[11:1] Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
[11:2] Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?
[11:3] Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
[11:4] For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.
[11:5] But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,
[11:6] And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
[11:7] Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
[11:8] It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?
[11:9] The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.
[11:10] If he pass through, and shut up, And all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?
[11:11] For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.
[11:12] But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born `as' a wild ass's colt.
[11:13] If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;
[11:14] If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.
[11:15] Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
[11:16] For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,
[11:17] And `thy' life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
[11:18] And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search `about thee', and shalt take thy rest in safety.
[11:19] Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
[11:20] But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.

[103:1] Bless Jehovah, O my soul; And all that is within me, `bless' his holy name.
[103:2] Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits:
[103:3] Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
[103:4] Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
[103:5] Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, `So that' thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
[103:6] Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed.
[103:7] He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.
[103:8] Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.
[103:9] He will not always chide; Neither will he keep `his anger' for ever.
[103:10] He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
[103:11] For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.
[103:12] As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
[103:13] Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.
[103:14] For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.
[103:15] As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
[103:16] For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.
[103:17] But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children's children;
[103:18] To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.
[103:19] Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.
[103:20] Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
[103:21] Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
[103:22] Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.

[44:1] We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work thou didst in their days, In the days of old.
[44:2] Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But them thou didst spread abroad.
[44:3] For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast favorable unto them.
[44:4] Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.
[44:5] Through thee will we push down our adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
[44:6] For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me.
[44:7] But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.
[44:8] In God have we made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah
[44:9] But now thou hast cast `us' off, and brought us to dishonor, And goest not forth with our hosts.
[44:10] Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.
[44:11] Thou hast made us like sheep `appointed' for food, And hast scattered us among the nations.
[44:12] Thou sellest thy people for nought, And hast not increased `thy wealth' by their price.
[44:13] Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.
[44:14] Thou makest us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.
[44:15] All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,
[44:16] For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.
[44:17] All this is come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
[44:18] Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from thy way,
[44:19] That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
[44:20] If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
[44:21] Will not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
[44:22] Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[44:23] Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, cast `us' not off for ever.
[44:24] Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
[44:25] For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body cleaveth unto the earth.
[44:26] Rise up for our help, And redeem us for thy lovingkindness' sake. Psalm 45 For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. `A Psalm' of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.

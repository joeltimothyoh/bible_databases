[33:1] Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.
[33:2] Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
[33:3] My words `shall utter' the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
[33:4] The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.
[33:5] If thou canst, answer thou me; Set `thy words' in order before me, stand forth.
[33:6] Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay.
[33:7] Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.
[33:8] Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of `thy' words, `saying',
[33:9] I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:
[33:10] Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy:
[33:11] He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.
[33:12] Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man.
[33:13] Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?
[33:14] For God speaketh once, Yea twice, `though man' regardeth it not.
[33:15] In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;
[33:16] Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction,
[33:17] That he may withdraw man `from his' purpose, And hide pride from man;
[33:18] He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.
[33:19] He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;
[33:20] So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food.
[33:21] His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.
[33:22] Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.
[33:23] If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him;
[33:24] Then `God' is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.
[33:25] His flesh shall be fresher than a child's; He returneth to the days of his youth.
[33:26] He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.
[33:27] He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:
[33:28] He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light.
[33:29] Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, `yea' thrice, with a man,
[33:30] To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
[33:31] Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak.
[33:32] If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
[33:33] If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.

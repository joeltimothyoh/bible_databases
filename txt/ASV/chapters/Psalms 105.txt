[105:1] Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.
[105:2] Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
[105:3] Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
[105:4] Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.
[105:5] Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
[105:6] O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
[105:7] He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.
[105:8] He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
[105:9] `The covenant' which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,
[105:10] And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
[105:11] Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;
[105:12] When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
[105:13] And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.
[105:14] He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
[105:15] `Saying', Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.
[105:16] And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.
[105:17] He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:
[105:18] His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in `chains of' iron,
[105:19] Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.
[105:20] The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
[105:21] He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;
[105:22] To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.
[105:23] Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
[105:24] And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.
[105:25] He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.
[105:26] He sent Moses his servant, `And' Aaron whom he had chosen.
[105:27] They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.
[105:28] He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.
[105:29] He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.
[105:30] Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.
[105:31] He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.
[105:32] He gave them hail for rain, `And' flaming fire in their land.
[105:33] He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.
[105:34] He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,
[105:35] And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
[105:36] He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.
[105:37] And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
[105:38] Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
[105:39] He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.
[105:40] They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
[105:41] He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places `like' a river.
[105:42] For he remembered his holy word, `And' Abraham his servant.
[105:43] And he brought forth his people with joy, `And' his chosen with singing.
[105:44] And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
[105:45] That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.

[9:1] I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.
[9:2] I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.
[9:3] When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence.
[9:4] For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.
[9:5] Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
[9:6] The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.
[9:7] But Jehovah sitteth `as king' for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;
[9:8] And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
[9:9] Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;
[9:10] And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
[9:11] Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.
[9:12] For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.
[9:13] Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction `which I suffer' of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;
[9:14] That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.
[9:15] The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
[9:16] Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah
[9:17] The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.
[9:18] For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.
[9:19] Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight.
[9:20] Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah

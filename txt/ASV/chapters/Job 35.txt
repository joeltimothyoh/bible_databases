[35:1] Moreover Elihu answered and said,
[35:2] Thinkest thou this to be `thy' right, `Or' sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God's,
[35:3] That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? `And', What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
[35:4] I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.
[35:5] Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
[35:6] If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
[35:7] If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?
[35:8] Thy wickedness `may hurt' a man as thou art; And thy righteousness `may profit' a son of man.
[35:9] By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
[35:10] But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,
[35:11] Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
[35:12] There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.
[35:13] Surely God will not hear an empty `cry', Neither will the Almighty regard it.
[35:14] How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!
[35:15] But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;
[35:16] Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.

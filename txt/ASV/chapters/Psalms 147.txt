[147:1] Praise ye Jehovah; For it is good to sing praises unto our God; For it is pleasant, `and' praise is comely.
[147:2] Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
[147:3] He healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds.
[147:4] He counteth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by `their' names.
[147:5] Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite.
[147:6] Jehovah upholdeth the meek: He bringeth the wicked down to the ground.
[147:7] Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; Sing praises upon the harp unto our God,
[147:8] Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
[147:9] He giveth to the beast his food, `And' to the young ravens which cry.
[147:10] He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.
[147:11] Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear him, In those that hope in his lovingkindness.
[147:12] Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; Praise thy God, O Zion.
[147:13] For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.
[147:14] He maketh peace in thy borders; He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
[147:15] He sendeth out his commandment upon earth; His word runneth very swiftly.
[147:16] He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
[147:17] He casteth forth his ice like morsels: Who can stand before his cold?
[147:18] He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
[147:19] He showeth his word unto Jacob, His statutes and his ordinances unto Israel.
[147:20] He hath not dealt so with any nation; And as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye Jehovah.

[66:1] Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:
[66:2] Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.
[66:3] Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
[66:4] All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. Selah
[66:5] Come, and see the works of God; `He is' terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
[66:6] He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him.
[66:7] He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
[66:8] Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard;
[66:9] Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved.
[66:10] For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
[66:11] Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
[66:12] Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
[66:13] I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
[66:14] Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress.
[66:15] I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah
[66:16] Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
[66:17] I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue.
[66:18] If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear:
[66:19] But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
[66:20] Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me. Psalm 67 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm, a song.

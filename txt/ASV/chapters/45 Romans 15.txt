[15:1] Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
[15:2] Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.
[15:3] For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.
[15:4] For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.
[15:5] Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:
[15:6] that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[15:7] Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.
[15:8] For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises `given' unto the fathers,
[15:9] and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.
[15:10] And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
[15:11] And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.
[15:12] And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.
[15:13] Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[15:14] And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
[15:15] But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,
[15:16] that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
[15:17] I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
[15:18] For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
[15:19] in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;
[15:20] yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was `already' named, that I might not build upon another man's foundation;
[15:21] but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.
[15:22] Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:
[15:23] but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,
[15:24] whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--
[15:25] but now, I `say', I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.
[15:26] For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.
[15:27] Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it `to them' also to minister unto them in carnal things.
[15:28] When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.
[15:29] And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.
[15:30] Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
[15:31] that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and `that' my ministration which `I have' for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
[15:32] that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.
[15:33] Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

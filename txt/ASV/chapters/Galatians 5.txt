[5:1] For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
[5:2] Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
[5:3] Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
[5:4] Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
[5:5] For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
[5:6] For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.
[5:7] Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?
[5:8] This persuasion `came' not of him that calleth you.
[5:9] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
[5:10] I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
[5:11] But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.
[5:12] I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
[5:13] For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only `use' not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.
[5:14] For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, `even' in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[5:15] But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
[5:16] But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
[5:17] For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.
[5:18] But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
[5:19] Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are `these': fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
[5:20] idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,
[5:21] envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[5:22] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[5:23] meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.
[5:24] And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.
[5:25] If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.
[5:26] Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.

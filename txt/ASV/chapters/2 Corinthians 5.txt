[5:1] For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
[5:2] For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:
[5:3] if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
[5:4] For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.
[5:5] Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
[5:6] Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord
[5:7] (for we walk by faith, not by sight);
[5:8] we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
[5:9] Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.
[5:10] For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things `done' in the body, according to what he hath done, whether `it be' good or bad.
[5:11] Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
[5:12] We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but `speak' as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.
[5:13] For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.
[5:14] For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;
[5:15] and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.
[5:16] Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know `him so' no more.
[5:17] Wherefore if any man is in Christ, `he is' a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.
[5:18] But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;
[5:19] to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
[5:20] We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech `you' on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.
[5:21] Him who knew no sin he made `to be' sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

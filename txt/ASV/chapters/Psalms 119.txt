[119:52] I have remembered thine ordinances of old, O Jehovah, And have comforted myself.
[119:53] Hot indignation hath taken hold upon me, Because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
[119:54] Thy statutes have been my songs In the house of my pilgrimage.
[119:55] I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, And have observed thy law.
[119:56] This I have had, Because I have kept thy precepts.

[119:59] I thought on my ways, And turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
[119:60] I made haste, and delayed not, To observe thy commandments.
[119:61] The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round; `But' I have not forgotten thy law.
[119:62] At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee Because of thy righteous ordinances.

[119:83] For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke; Yet do I not forget thy statutes.
[119:84] How many are the days of thy servant? When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
[119:85] The proud have digged pits for me, Who are not according to thy law.

[119:115] Depart from me, ye evil-doers, That I may keep the commandments of my God.
[119:116] Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; And let me not be ashamed of my hope.
[119:117] Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe, And shall have respect unto thy statutes continually.
[119:118] Thou hast set at nought all them that err from thy statutes; For their deceit is falsehood.
[119:119] Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: Therefore I love thy testimonies.
[119:120] My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; And I am afraid of thy judgments.

[119:125] I am thy servant; give me understanding, That I may know thy testimonies.
[119:126] It is time for Jehovah to work; `For' they have made void thy law.
[119:127] Therefore I love thy commandments Above gold, yea, above fine gold.

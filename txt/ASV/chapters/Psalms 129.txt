[129:1] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say,
[129:2] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me.
[129:3] The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.
[129:4] Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
[129:5] Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.
[129:6] Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up;
[129:7] Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
[129:8] Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah. Psalm 130 A Song of Ascents.

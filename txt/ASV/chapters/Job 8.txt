[8:1] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
[8:2] How long wilt thou speak these things? And `how long' shall the words of thy mouth be `like' a mighty wind?
[8:3] Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?
[8:4] If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;
[8:5] If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
[8:6] If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
[8:7] And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
[8:8] For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:
[8:9] (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow);
[8:10] Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?
[8:11] Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water?
[8:12] Whilst it is yet in its greenness, `and' not cut down, It withereth before any `other' herb.
[8:13] So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish:
[8:14] Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider's web.
[8:15] He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
[8:16] He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.
[8:17] His roots are wrapped about the `stone' -heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.
[8:18] If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, `saying', I have not seen thee.
[8:19] Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring.
[8:20] Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.
[8:21] He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.
[8:22] They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.

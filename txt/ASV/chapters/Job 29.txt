[29:1] And Job again took up his parable, and said,
[29:2] Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;
[29:3] When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;
[29:4] As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;
[29:5] When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;
[29:6] When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!
[29:7] When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,
[29:8] The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;
[29:9] The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;
[29:10] The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
[29:11] For when the ear heard `me', then it blessed me; And when the eye saw `me', it gave witness unto me:
[29:12] Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
[29:13] The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
[29:14] I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
[29:15] I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.
[29:16] I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
[29:17] And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
[29:18] Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:
[29:19] My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;
[29:20] My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.
[29:21] Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.
[29:22] After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.
[29:23] And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide `as' for the latter rain.
[29:24] I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
[29:25] I chose out their way, and sat `as' chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.

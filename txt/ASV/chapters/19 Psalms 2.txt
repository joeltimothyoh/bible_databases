[2:1] Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?
[2:2] The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, `saying',
[2:3] Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.
[2:4] He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.
[2:5] Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:
[2:6] Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.
[2:7] I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.
[2:8] Ask of me, and I will give `thee' the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
[2:9] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
[2:10] Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
[2:11] Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
[2:12] Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him. Psalm 3 A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.

[126:1] When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.
[126:2] Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.
[126:3] Jehovah hath done great things for us, `Whereof' we are glad.
[126:4] Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South.
[126:5] They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
[126:6] He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves `with him'. Psalm 127 A Song of Ascents; of Solomon.

[83:1] O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
[83:2] For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
[83:3] Thy take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.
[83:4] They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
[83:5] For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:
[83:6] The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;
[83:7] Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
[83:8] Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. Selah
[83:9] Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
[83:10] Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.
[83:11] Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
[83:12] Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.
[83:13] O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.
[83:14] As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,
[83:15] So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm.
[83:16] Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.
[83:17] Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;
[83:18] That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth. Psalm 84 For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.

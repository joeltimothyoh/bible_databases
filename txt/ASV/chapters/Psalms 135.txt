[135:1] Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah; Praise `him', O ye servants of Jehovah,
[135:2] Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.
[135:3] Praise ye Jehovah; for Jehovah is good: Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
[135:4] For Jehovah hath chosen Jacob unto himself, `And' Israel for his own possession.
[135:5] For I know that Jehovah is great, And that our Lord is above all gods.
[135:6] Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath he done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
[135:7] Who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who maketh lightnings for the rain; Who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries;
[135:8] Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast;
[135:9] Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants;
[135:10] Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings,
[135:11] Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan,
[135:12] And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage unto Israel his people.
[135:13] Thy name, O Jehovah, `endureth' for ever; Thy memorial `name', O Jehovah, throughout all generations.
[135:14] For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself concerning his servants.
[135:15] The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
[135:16] They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;
[135:17] They have ears, but they hear not; Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
[135:18] They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
[135:19] O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah: O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah:
[135:20] O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah: Ye that fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
[135:21] Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.

[7:1] And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
[7:2] Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
[7:3] His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.
[7:4] For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.
[7:5] For even his brethren did not believe on him.
[7:6] Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
[7:7] The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
[7:8] Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.
[7:9] And having said these things unto them, he abode `still' in Galilee.
[7:10] But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
[7:11] The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
[7:12] And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.
[7:13] Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
[7:14] But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
[7:15] The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
[7:16] Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.
[7:17] If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or `whether' I speak from myself.
[7:18] He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
[7:19] Did not Moses give you the law, and `yet' none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?
[7:20] The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?
[7:21] Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.
[7:22] Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
[7:23] If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?
[7:24] Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
[7:25] Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
[7:26] And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?
[7:27] Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.
[7:28] Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
[7:29] I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
[7:30] They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.
[7:31] But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?
[7:32] The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.
[7:33] Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.
[7:34] Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
[7:35] The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
[7:36] What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
[7:37] Now on the last day, the great `day' of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[7:38] He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
[7:39] But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet `given'; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[7:40] `Some' of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.
[7:41] Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
[7:42] Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
[7:43] So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
[7:44] And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
[7:45] The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?
[7:46] The officers answered, Never man so spake.
[7:47] The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?
[7:48] Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?
[7:49] But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.
[7:50] Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),
[7:51] Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?
[7:52] They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
[7:53] And they went every man unto his own house:

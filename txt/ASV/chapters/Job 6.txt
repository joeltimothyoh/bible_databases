[6:1] Then Job answered and said,
[6:2] Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!
[6:3] For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.
[6:4] For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
[6:5] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
[6:6] Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
[6:7] My soul refuseth to touch `them'; They are as loathsome food to me.
[6:8] Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant `me' the thing that I long for!
[6:9] Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
[6:10] And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
[6:11] What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?
[6:12] Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?
[6:13] Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?
[6:14] To him that is ready to faint kindness `should be showed' from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
[6:15] My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;
[6:16] Which are black by reason of the ice, `And' wherein the snow hideth itself:
[6:17] What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
[6:18] The caravans `that travel' by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.
[6:19] The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.
[6:20] They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.
[6:21] For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.
[6:22] Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?
[6:23] Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
[6:24] Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
[6:25] How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?
[6:26] Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?
[6:27] Yea, ye would cast `lots' upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.
[6:28] Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.
[6:29] Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.
[6:30] Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?

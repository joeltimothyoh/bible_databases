[5:1] But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.
[5:2] For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
[5:3] When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.
[5:4] But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:
[5:5] for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;
[5:6] so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.
[5:7] For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.
[5:8] But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
[5:9] For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[5:10] who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
[5:11] Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.
[5:12] But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
[5:13] and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
[5:14] And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.
[5:15] See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.
[5:16] Rejoice always;
[5:17] pray without ceasing;
[5:18] in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.
[5:19] Quench not the Spirit;
[5:20] despise not prophesyings;
[5:21] prove all things; hold fast that which is good;
[5:22] abstain from every form of evil.
[5:23] And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5:24] Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.
[5:25] Brethren, pray for us.
[5:26] Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
[5:27] I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.
[5:28] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

[10:1] Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
[10:2] In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
[10:3] For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, And the covetous renounceth, `yea', contemneth Jehovah.
[10:4] The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, `saith', He will not require `it'. All his thoughts are, There is no God.
[10:5] His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
[10:6] He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
[10:7] His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
[10:8] He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
[10:9] He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
[10:10] He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
[10:11] He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it.
[10:12] Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor.
[10:13] Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require `it'?
[10:14] Thou hast seen `it'; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth `himself' unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
[10:15] Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
[10:16] Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land.
[10:17] Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;
[10:18] To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more. Psalm 11 For the Chief Musician. `A Psalm' of David.

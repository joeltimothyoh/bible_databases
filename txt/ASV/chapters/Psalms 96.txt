[96:1] Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth.
[96:2] Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; Show forth his salvation from day to day.
[96:3] Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.
[96:4] For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods.
[96:5] For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.
[96:6] Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
[96:7] Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
[96:8] Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
[96:9] Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: Tremble before him, all the earth.
[96:10] Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved: He will judge the peoples with equity.
[96:11] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
[96:12] Let the field exult, and all that is therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy
[96:13] Before Jehovah; for he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth.

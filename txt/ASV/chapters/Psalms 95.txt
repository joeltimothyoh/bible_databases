[95:1] Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
[95:2] Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
[95:3] For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods.
[95:4] In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.
[95:5] The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land.
[95:6] Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:
[95:7] For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!
[95:8] Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
[95:9] When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work.
[95:10] Forty years long was I grieved with `that' generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways:
[95:11] Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.

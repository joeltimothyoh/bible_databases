[102:1] Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee.
[102:2] Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.
[102:3] For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand.
[102:4] My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread.
[102:5] By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh.
[102:6] I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.
[102:7] I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top.
[102:8] Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me.
[102:9] For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,
[102:10] Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.
[102:11] My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass.
[102:12] But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; And thy memorial `name' unto all generations.
[102:13] Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come.
[102:14] For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust.
[102:15] So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.
[102:16] For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory.
[102:17] He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.
[102:18] This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.
[102:19] For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;
[102:20] To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;
[102:21] That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;
[102:22] When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.
[102:23] He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.
[102:24] I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations.
[102:25] Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
[102:26] They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
[102:27] But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end.
[102:28] The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee. Psalm 103 `A Psalm' of David.

[32:1] Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
[32:2] Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.
[32:3] When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long.
[32:4] For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed `as' with the drought of summer. Selah
[32:5] I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah
[32:6] For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.
[32:7] Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah
[32:8] I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.
[32:9] Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, `Else' they will not come near unto thee.
[32:10] Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.
[32:11] Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

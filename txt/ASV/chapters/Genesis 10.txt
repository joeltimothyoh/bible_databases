[10:1] Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, `namely', of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
[10:2] The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
[10:3] And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
[10:4] And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
[10:5] Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
[10:6] And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
[10:7] And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
[10:8] And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
[10:9] He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.
[10:10] And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
[10:11] Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,
[10:12] and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
[10:13] And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
[10:14] and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
[10:15] And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
[10:16] and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
[10:17] and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
[10:18] and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
[10:19] And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
[10:20] These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
[10:21] And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
[10:22] The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
[10:23] And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
[10:24] And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
[10:25] And unto Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother's name was Joktan.
[10:26] And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
[10:27] and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
[10:28] and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
[10:29] and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
[10:30] And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
[10:31] These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
[10:32] These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

[120:1] &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; In my trouble my cry went up to the Lord, and he gave me an answer.
[120:2] O Lord, be the saviour of my soul from false lips, and from the tongue of deceit.
[120:3] What punishment will he give you? what more will he do to you, you false tongue?
[120:4] Sharp arrows of the strong, and burning fire.
[120:5] Sorrow is mine because I am strange in Meshech, and living in the tents of Kedar.
[120:6] My soul has long been living with the haters of peace.
[120:7] I am for peace: but when I say so, they are for war.

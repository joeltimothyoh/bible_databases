[33:1] Be glad in the Lord, O doers of righteousness; for praise is beautiful for the upright.
[33:2] Give praise to the Lord on the corded instrument; make melody to him with instruments of music.
[33:3] Make a new song to him; playing expertly with a loud noise.
[33:4] For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are certain.
[33:5] His delight is in righteousness and wisdom; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
[33:6] By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the army of heaven by the breath of his mouth.
[33:7] He makes the waters of the sea come together in a mass; he keeps the deep seas in store-houses.
[33:8] Let the earth be full of the fear of the Lord; let all the people of the world be in holy fear of him.
[33:9] For he gave the word, and it was done; by his order it was fixed for ever.
[33:10] The Lord undoes the designs of the nations; he makes the thoughts of the peoples without effect.
[33:11] The Lord's purpose is eternal, the designs of his heart go on through all the generations of man.
[33:12] Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he has taken for his heritage.
[33:13] The Lord is looking down from heaven; he sees all the sons of men;
[33:14] From his house he keeps watch on all who are living on the earth;
[33:15] He makes all their hearts; their works are clear to him.
[33:16] A king's salvation is not in the power of his army; a strong man does not get free by his great strength.
[33:17] A horse is a false hope; his great power will not make any man free from danger.
[33:18] See, the eye of the Lord is on those in whose hearts is the fear of him, on those whose hope is in his mercy;
[33:19] To keep their souls from death; and to keep them living in time of need.
[33:20] Our souls are waiting for the Lord; he is our help and our salvation.
[33:21] For in him our hearts have joy; in his holy name is our hope.
[33:22] Let your mercy be on us, O Lord, as we are waiting for you.

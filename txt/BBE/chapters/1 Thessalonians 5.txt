[5:1] But about the times and their order, my brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you.
[5:2] For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[5:3] When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it.
[5:4] But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief:
[5:5] For you are all sons of light and of the day: we are not of the night or of the dark.
[5:6] So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self-controlled and awake.
[5:7] For those who are sleeping do so in the night; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night;
[5:8] But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation.
[5:9] For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[5:10] Who was put to death for us, so that, awake or sleeping, we may have a part in his life.
[5:11] So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing.
[5:12] But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you;
[5:13] And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
[5:14] And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all.
[5:15] Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all.
[5:16] Have joy at all times.
[5:17] Keep on with your prayers.
[5:18] In everything give praise: for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you.
[5:19] Do not put out the light of the Spirit;
[5:20] Do not make little of the words of the prophets;
[5:21] Let all things be tested; keep to what is good;
[5:22] Keep from every form of evil.
[5:23] And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5:24] God, by whom you have been marked out in his purpose, is unchanging and will make it complete.
[5:25] Brothers, keep us in mind in your prayers.
[5:26] Give all the brothers a holy kiss.
[5:27] I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter.
[5:28] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

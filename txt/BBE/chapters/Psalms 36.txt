[36:1] &lt;To the chief music-maker. Of the servant of the Lord. Of David.&gt; The sin of the evil-doer says in his heart, There is no fear of the Lord before his eyes.
[36:2] For he takes comfort in the thought that his sin will not be uncovered and hated.
[36:3] In the words of his mouth are evil and deceit; he has given up being wise and doing good.
[36:4] He gives thought to evil on his bed; he takes a way which is not good; he is not a hater of evil.
[36:5] Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and your strong purpose is as high as the clouds.
[36:6] Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judging is like the great deep; O Lord, you give life to man and beast.
[36:7] How good is your loving mercy, O God! the children of men take cover under the shade of your wings.
[36:8] The delights of your house will be showered on them; you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures.
[36:9] For with you is the fountain of life: in your light we will see light.
[36:10] O let there be no end to your loving mercy to those who have knowledge of you, or of your righteousness to the upright in heart.
[36:11] Let not the foot of pride come against me, or the hand of the evil-doers put me out of my place.
[36:12] There the workers of evil have come down: they have been made low, and will not be lifted up.

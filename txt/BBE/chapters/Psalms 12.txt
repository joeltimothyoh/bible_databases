[12:1] &lt;For the chief music-maker on the Sheminith. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Send help, Lord, for mercy has come to an end; there is no more faith among the children of men.
[12:2] Everyone says false words to his neighbour: their tongues are smooth in their talk, and their hearts are full of deceit.
[12:3] The smooth lips and the tongue of pride will be cut off by the Lord.
[12:4] They have said, With our tongues will we overcome; our lips are ours: who is lord over us?
[12:5] Because of the crushing of the poor and the weeping of those in need, now will I come to his help, says the Lord; I will give him the salvation which he is desiring.
[12:6] The words of the Lord are true words: like silver tested by fire and burned clean seven times.
[12:7] You will keep them, O Lord, you will keep them safe from this generation for ever.
[12:8] The sinners are walking on every side, and evil is honoured among the children of men.

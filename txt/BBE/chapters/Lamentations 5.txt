[5:1] Keep in mind, O Lord, what has come to us: take note and see our shame.
[5:2] Our heritage is given up to men of strange lands, our houses to those who are not our countrymen.
[5:3] We are children without fathers, our mothers are like widows.
[5:4] We give money for a drink of water, we get our wood for a price.
[5:5] Our attackers are on our necks: overcome with weariness, we have no rest.
[5:6] We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread.
[5:7] Our fathers were sinners and are dead; and the weight of their evil-doing is on us.
[5:8] Servants are ruling over us, and there is no one to make us free from their hands.
[5:9] We put our lives in danger to get our bread, because of the sword of the waste land.
[5:10] Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food.
[5:11] They took by force the women in Zion, the virgins in the towns of Judah.
[5:12] Their hands put princes to death by hanging: the faces of old men were not honoured.
[5:13] The young men were crushing the grain, and the boys were falling under the wood.
[5:14] The old men are no longer seated in the doorway, and the music of the young men has come to an end.
[5:15] The joy of our hearts is ended; our dancing is changed into sorrow.
[5:16] The crown has been taken from our head: sorrow is ours, for we are sinners.
[5:17] Because of this our hearts are feeble; for these things our eyes are dark;
[5:18] Because of the mountain of Zion which is a waste; jackals go over it.
[5:19] You, O Lord, are seated as King for ever; the seat of your power is eternal.
[5:20] Why have we gone from your memory for ever? why have you been turned away from us for so long?
[5:21] Make us come back to you, O Lord, and let us be turned; make our days new again as in the past.
[5:22] But you have quite given us up; you are full of wrath against us.

[109:1] &lt;To the chief music-maker. Of David. A Psalm.&gt; God of my praise, let my prayer be answered;
[109:2] For the mouth of the sinner is open against me in deceit: his tongue has said false things against me.
[109:3] Words of hate are round about me; they have made war against me without cause.
[109:4] For my love they give me back hate; but I have given myself to prayer.
[109:5] They have put on me evil for good; hate in exchange for my love.
[109:6] Put an evil man over him; and let one be placed at his right hand to say evil of him.
[109:7] When he is judged, let the decision go against him; and may his prayer become sin.
[109:8] Let his life be short; let another take his position of authority.
[109:9] Let his children have no father, and his wife be made a widow.
[109:10] Let his children be wanderers, looking to others for their food; let them be sent away from the company of their friends.
[109:11] Let his creditor take all his goods; and let others have the profit of his work.
[109:12] Let no man have pity on him, or give help to his children when he is dead.
[109:13] Let his seed be cut off; in the coming generation let their name go out of memory.
[109:14] Let the Lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers; and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness.
[109:15] Let them be ever before the eyes of the Lord, so that the memory of them may be cut off from the earth.
[109:16] Because he had no mercy, but was cruel to the low and the poor, designing the death of the broken-hearted.
[109:17] As he took pleasure in cursing, so let it come on him; and as he had no delight in blessing, let it be far from him.
[109:18] He put on cursing like a robe, and it has come into his body like water, and into his bones like oil.
[109:19] Let it be to him as a robe which he puts on, let it be like a band which is round him at all times.
[109:20] Let this be the reward given to my haters from the Lord, and to those who say evil of my soul.
[109:21] But, O Lord God, give me your help, because of your name; take me out of danger, because your mercy is good.
[109:22] For I am poor and in need, and my heart is wounded in me.
[109:23] I am gone like the shade when it is stretched out: I am forced out of my place like a locust.
[109:24] My knees are feeble for need of food; there is no fat on my bones.
[109:25] As for me, they make sport of me; shaking their heads when they see me.
[109:26] Give me help, O Lord my God; in your mercy be my saviour;
[109:27] So that they may see that it is the work of your hand; that you, Lord, have done it.
[109:28] They may give curses but you give blessing; when they come up against me, put them to shame; but let your servant be glad.
[109:29] Let my haters be clothed with shame, covering themselves with shame as with a robe.
[109:30] I will give the Lord great praise with my mouth; yes, I will give praise to him among all the people.
[109:31] For he is ever at the right hand of the poor, to take him out of the hands of those who go after his soul.

[26:1] &lt;Of David.&gt; O Lord, be my judge, for my behaviour has been upright: I have put my faith in the Lord, I am not in danger of slipping.
[26:2] Put me in the scales, O Lord, so that I may be tested; let the fire make clean my thoughts and my heart.
[26:3] For your mercy is before my eyes; and I have gone in the way of your good faith.
[26:4] I have not taken my seat with foolish persons, and I do not go with false men.
[26:5] I have been a hater of the band of wrongdoers, and I will not be seated among sinners.
[26:6] I will make my hands clean from sin; so will I go round your altar, O Lord;
[26:7] That I may give out the voice of praise, and make public all the wonders which you have done.
[26:8] Lord, your house has been dear to me, and the resting-place of your glory.
[26:9] Let not my soul be numbered among sinners, or my life among men of blood;
[26:10] In whose hands are evil designs, and whose right hands take money for judging falsely.
[26:11] But as for me, I will go on in my upright ways: be my saviour, and have mercy on me.
[26:12] I have a safe resting-place for my feet; I will give praise to the Lord in the meetings of the people.

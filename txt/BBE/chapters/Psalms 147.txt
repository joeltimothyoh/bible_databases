[147:1] Give praise to the Lord; for it is good to make melody to our God; praise is pleasing and beautiful.
[147:2] The Lord is building up Jerusalem; he makes all the outlaws of Israel come together.
[147:3] He makes the broken-hearted well, and puts oil on their wounds.
[147:4] He sees the number of the stars; he gives them all their names.
[147:5] Great is our Lord, and great his power; there is no limit to his wisdom.
[147:6] The Lord gives help to the poor in spirit; but he sends sinners down in shame.
[147:7] Make songs of praise to the Lord; make melody to our God with instruments of music.
[147:8] By his hand the heaven is covered with clouds and rain is stored up for the earth; he makes the grass tall on the mountains.
[147:9] He gives food to every beast, and to the young ravens in answer to their cry.
[147:10] He has no delight in the strength of a horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
[147:11] The Lord takes pleasure in his worshippers, and in those whose hope is in his mercy.
[147:12] Give praise to the Lord, O Jerusalem; give praise to your God, O Zion.
[147:13] He has made strong the iron bands of your doors; he has sent blessings on your children inside your walls.
[147:14] He gives peace in all your land, making your stores full of fat grain.
[147:15] He sends out his orders to the earth; his word goes out quickly.
[147:16] He gives snow like wool; he sends out ice-drops like dust.
[147:17] He sends down ice like raindrops: water is made hard by his cold.
[147:18] At the outgoing of his word, the ice is turned to water; when he sends out his wind, there is a flowing of waters.
[147:19] He makes his word clear to Jacob, teaching Israel his laws and his decisions.
[147:20] He has not done these things for any other nation: and as for his laws, they have no knowledge of them. Let the Lord be praised.

[82:1] &lt;A Psalm. Of Asaph.&gt; God is in the meeting-place of God; he is judging among the gods.
[82:2] How long will you go on judging falsely, having respect for the persons of evil-doers? (Selah.)
[82:3] Give ear to the cause of the poor and the children without fathers; let those who are troubled and in need have their rights.
[82:4] Be the saviour of the poor and those who have nothing: take them out of the hand of the evil-doers.
[82:5] They have no knowledge or sense; they go about in the dark: all the bases of the earth are moved.
[82:6] I said, You are gods; all of you are the sons of the Most High:
[82:7] But you will come to death like men, falling like one of the rulers of the earth.
[82:8] Up! O God, come as judge of the earth; for all the nations are your heritage.

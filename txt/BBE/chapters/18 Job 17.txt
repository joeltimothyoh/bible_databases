[17:1] My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me.
[17:2] Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing.
[17:3] Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine.
[17:4] You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour.
[17:5] As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children.
[17:6] He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport.
[17:7] My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade.
[17:8] The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers.
[17:9] Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength.
[17:10] But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you.
[17:11] My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart.
[17:12] They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark.
[17:13] If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark;
[17:14] If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister;
[17:15] Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire?
[17:16] Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust?

[95:1] O come, let us make songs to the Lord; sending up glad voices to the Rock of our salvation.
[95:2] Let us come before his face with praises; and make melody with holy songs.
[95:3] For the Lord is a great God, and a great King over all gods.
[95:4] The deep places of the earth are in his hand; and the tops of the mountains are his.
[95:5] The sea is his, and he made it; and the dry land was formed by his hands.
[95:6] O come, let us give worship, falling down on our knees before the Lord our Maker.
[95:7] For he is our God; and we are the people to whom he gives food, and the sheep of his flock. Today, if you would only give ear to his voice!
[95:8] Let not your hearts be hard, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the waste land;
[95:9] When your fathers put me to the test and saw my power and my work.
[95:10] For forty years I was angry with this generation, and said, They are a people whose hearts are turned away from me, for they have no knowledge of my ways;
[95:11] And I made an oath in my wrath, that they might not come into my place of rest.

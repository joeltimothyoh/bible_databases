[19:1] Better is the poor man whose ways are upright, than the man of wealth whose ways are twisted.
[19:2] Further, without knowledge desire is not good; and he who is over-quick in acting goes out of the right way.
[19:3] By his foolish behaviour a man's ways are turned upside down, and his heart is bitter against the Lord.
[19:4] Wealth makes a great number of friends; but the poor man is parted from his friend.
[19:5] A false witness will not go without punishment, and the breather out of deceit will not go free.
[19:6] Great numbers will make attempts to get the approval of a ruler: and every man is the special friend of him who has something to give.
[19:7] All the brothers of the poor man are against him: how much more do his friends go far from him! ...
[19:8] He who gets wisdom has love for his soul: he who keeps good sense will get what is truly good.
[19:9] A false witness will not go without punishment, and the breather out of deceit will be cut off.
[19:10] Material comfort is not good for the foolish; much less for a servant to be put over rulers.
[19:11] A man's good sense makes him slow to wrath, and the overlooking of wrongdoing is his glory.
[19:12] The king's wrath is like the loud cry of a lion, but his approval is like dew on the grass.
[19:13] A foolish son is the destruction of his father; and the bitter arguments of a wife are like drops of rain falling without end.
[19:14] House and wealth are a heritage from fathers, but a wife with good sense is from the Lord.
[19:15] Hate of work sends deep sleep on a man: and he who has no industry will go without food.
[19:16] He who keeps the law keeps his soul; but death will be the fate of him who takes no note of the word.
[19:17] He who has pity on the poor gives to the Lord, and the Lord will give him his reward.
[19:18] Give your son training while there is hope; let not your heart be purposing his death.
[19:19] A man of great wrath will have to take his punishment: for if you get him out of trouble you will have to do it again.
[19:20] Let your ear be open to suggestion and take teaching, so that at the end you may be wise.
[19:21] A man's heart may be full of designs, but the purpose of the Lord is unchanging.
[19:22] The ornament of a man is his mercy, and a poor man is better than one who is false.
[19:23] The fear of the Lord gives life: and he who has it will have need of nothing; no evil will come his way.
[19:24] The hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin, and will not even take it to his mouth again.
[19:25] When blows overtake the man of pride, the simple will get sense; say sharp words to the wise, and knowledge will be made clear to him.
[19:26] He who is violent to his father, driving away his mother, is a son causing shame and a bad name.
[19:27] A son who no longer gives attention to teaching is turned away from the words of knowledge.
[19:28] A good-for-nothing witness makes sport of the judge's decision: and the mouth of evil-doers sends out evil like a stream.
[19:29] Rods are being made ready for the man of pride, and blows for the back of the foolish.

[25:1] Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,
[25:2] Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places.
[25:3] Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining?
[25:4] How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman?
[25:5] See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes:
[25:6] How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!

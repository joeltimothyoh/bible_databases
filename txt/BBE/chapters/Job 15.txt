[15:1] And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,
[15:2] Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind?
[15:3] Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value?
[15:4] Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry.
[15:5] For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself.
[15:6] It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you.
[15:7] Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills?
[15:8] Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself?
[15:9] What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours?
[15:10] With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father.
[15:11] Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you?
[15:12] Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up;
[15:13] So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth?
[15:14] What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright?
[15:15] Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes;
[15:16] How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water!
[15:17] Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen:
[15:18] (The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us;
[15:19] For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:)
[15:20] The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small.
[15:21] A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:
[15:22] He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword;
[15:23] He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him:
[15:24] He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him:
[15:25] Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all,
[15:26] Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight,
[15:27] Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick;
[15:28] And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls.
[15:29] He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth.
[15:30] He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud.
[15:31] Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.
[15:32] His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green.
[15:33] He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers.
[15:34] For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.
[15:35] Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.

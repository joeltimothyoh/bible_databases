[8:1] Is not wisdom crying out, and the voice of knowledge sounding?
[8:2] At the top of the highways, at the meeting of the roads, she takes her place;
[8:3] Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out, at the doorways her voice is loud:
[8:4] I am crying out to you, O men; my voice comes to the sons of men.
[8:5] Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart.
[8:6] Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright.
[8:7] For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me.
[8:8] All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them.
[8:9] They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge.
[8:10] Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold.
[8:11] For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her.
[8:12] I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes.
[8:13] The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me.
[8:14] Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine.
[8:15] Through me kings have their power, and rulers give right decisions.
[8:16] Through me chiefs have authority, and the noble ones are judging in righteousness.
[8:17] Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me.
[8:18] Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness.
[8:19] My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver.
[8:20] I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging:
[8:21] So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store-houses full.
[8:22] The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past.
[8:23] From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was.
[8:24] When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water.
[8:25] Before the mountains were put in their places, before the hills was my birth:
[8:26] When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world.
[8:27] When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep:
[8:28] When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed:
[8:29] When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth:
[8:30] Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times;
[8:31] Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.
[8:32] Give ear to me then, my sons: for happy are those who keep my ways.
[8:33] Take my teaching and be wise; do not let it go.
[8:34] Happy is the man who gives ear to me, watching at my doors day by day, keeping his place by the pillars of my house.
[8:35] For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him.
[8:36] But he who does evil to me, does wrong to his soul: all my haters are in love with death.

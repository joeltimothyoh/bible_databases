[9:1] &lt;To the chief music-maker on Muthlabben. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; I will give you praise, O Lord, with all my heart; I will make clear all the wonder of your works.
[9:2] I will be glad and have delight in you: I will make a song of praise to your name, O Most High.
[9:3] When my haters are turned back, they will be broken and overcome before you.
[9:4] For you gave approval to my right and my cause; you were seated in your high place judging in righteousness.
[9:5] You have said sharp words to the nations, you have sent destruction on the sinners, you have put an end to their name for ever and ever.
[9:6] You have given their towns to destruction; the memory of them has gone; they have become waste for ever.
[9:7] But the Lord is King for ever: he has made ready his high seat for judging.
[9:8] And he will be the judge of the world in righteousness, giving true decisions for the peoples.
[9:9] The Lord will be a high tower for those who are crushed down, a high tower in times of trouble;
[9:10] And those who have knowledge of your name will put their faith in you; because you, Lord, have ever given your help to those who were waiting for you.
[9:11] Make songs of praise to the Lord, whose house is in Zion: make his doings clear to the people.
[9:12] When he makes search for blood, he has them in his memory: he is not without thought for the cry of the poor.
[9:13] Have mercy on me, O Lord, and see how I am troubled by my haters; let me be lifted up from the doors of death;
[9:14] So that I may make clear all your praise in the house of the daughter of Zion: I will be glad because of your salvation.
[9:15] The nations have gone down into the hole which they made: in their secret net is their foot taken.
[9:16] The Lord has given knowledge of himself through his judging: the evil-doer is taken in the net which his hands had made. (Higgaion. Selah.)
[9:17] The sinners and all the nations who have no memory of God will be turned into the underworld.
[9:18] For the poor will not be without help; the hopes of those in need will not be crushed for ever.
[9:19] Up! O Lord; let not man overcome you: let the nations be judged before you.
[9:20] Put them in fear, O Lord, so that the nations may see that they are only men. (Selah.)

[22:1] A good name is more to be desired than great wealth, and to be respected is better than silver and gold.
[22:2] The man of wealth and the poor man come face to face: the Lord is the maker of them all.
[22:3] The sharp man sees the evil and takes cover: the simple go straight on and get into trouble.
[22:4] The reward of a gentle spirit and the fear of the Lord is wealth and honour and life.
[22:5] Thorns and nets are in the way of the twisted: he who keeps watch over his soul will be far from them.
[22:6] If a child is trained up in the right way, even when he is old he will not be turned away from it.
[22:7] The man of wealth has rule over the poor, and he who gets into debt is a servant to his creditor.
[22:8] By planting the seed of evil a man will get in the grain of sorrow, and the rod of his wrath will be broken.
[22:9] He who is kind will have a blessing, for he gives of his bread to the poor.
[22:10] Send away the man of pride, and argument will go out; truly fighting and shame will come to an end.
[22:11] He whose heart is clean is dear to the Lord; for the grace of his lips the king will be his friend.
[22:12] The eyes of the Lord keep knowledge, but by him the acts of the false man will be overturned.
[22:13] The hater of work says, There is a lion outside: I will be put to death in the streets.
[22:14] The mouth of strange women is a deep hole: he with whom the Lord is angry will go down into it.
[22:15] Foolish ways are deep-seated in the heart of a child, but the rod of punishment will send them far from him.
[22:16] He who is cruel to the poor for the purpose of increasing his profit, and he who gives to the man of wealth, will only come to be in need.
[22:17] Let your ear be bent down for hearing my words, and let your heart give thought to knowledge.
[22:18] For it is a delight to keep them in your heart, to have them ready on your lips.
[22:19] So that your faith may be in the Lord, I have made them clear to you this day, even to you.
[22:20] Have I not put in writing for you thirty sayings, with wise suggestions and knowledge,
[22:21] To make you see how certain are true words, so that you may give a true answer to those who put questions to you?
[22:22] Do not take away the property of the poor man because he is poor, or be cruel to the crushed ones when they come before the judge:
[22:23] For the Lord will give support to their cause, and take the life of those who take their goods.
[22:24] Do not be friends with a man who is given to wrath; do not go in the company of an angry man:
[22:25] For fear of learning his ways and making a net ready for your soul.
[22:26] Be not one of those who give their hands in an agreement, or of those who make themselves responsible for debts:
[22:27] If you have nothing with which to make payment, he will take away your bed from under you.
[22:28] Let not the old landmark be moved which your fathers have put in place.
[22:29] Have you seen a man who is expert in his business? he will take his place before kings; his place will not be among low persons.

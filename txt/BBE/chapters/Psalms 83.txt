[83:1] &lt;A Song. A Psalm. Of Asaph.&gt; O God, do not keep quiet: let your lips be open and take no rest, O God.
[83:2] For see! those who make war on you are out of control; your haters are lifting up their heads.
[83:3] They have made wise designs against your people, talking together against those whom you keep in a secret place.
[83:4] They have said, Come, let us put an end to them as a nation; so that the name of Israel may go out of man's memory.
[83:5] For they have all come to an agreement; they are all joined together against you:
[83:6] The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagarites;
[83:7] Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; the Philistines and the people of Tyre;
[83:8] Assur is joined with them; they have become the support of the children of Lot. (Selah.)
[83:9] Do to them what you did to the Midianites; what you did to Sisera and Jabin, at the stream of Kishon:
[83:10] Who came to destruction at En-dor; their bodies became dust and waste.
[83:11] Make their chiefs like Oreb and Zeeb; and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna:
[83:12] Who have said, Let us take for our heritage the resting-place of God.
[83:13] O my God, make them like the rolling dust; like dry stems before the wind.
[83:14] As fire burning a wood, and as a flame causing fire on the mountains,
[83:15] So go after them with your strong wind, and let them be full of fear because of your storm.
[83:16] Let their faces be full of shame; so that they may give honour to your name, O Lord.
[83:17] Let them be overcome and troubled for ever; let them be put to shame and come to destruction;
[83:18] So that men may see that you only, whose name is Yahweh, are Most High over all the earth.

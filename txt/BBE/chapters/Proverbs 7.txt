[7:1] My son, keep my sayings, and let my rules be stored up with you.
[7:2] Keep my rules and you will have life; let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes;
[7:3] Let them be fixed to your fingers, and recorded in your heart.
[7:4] Say to wisdom, You are my sister; let knowledge be named your special friend:
[7:5] So that they may keep you from the strange woman, even from her whose words are smooth.
[7:6] Looking out from my house, and watching through the window,
[7:7] I saw among the young men one without sense,
[7:8] Walking in the street near the turn of her road, going on the way to her house,
[7:9] At nightfall, in the evening of the day, in the black dark of the night.
[7:10] And the woman came out to him, in the dress of a loose woman, with a designing heart;
[7:11] She is full of noise and uncontrolled; her feet keep not in her house.
[7:12] Now she is in the street, now in the open spaces, waiting at every turning of the road.
[7:13] So she took him by his hand, kissing him, and without a sign of shame she said to him:
[7:14] I have a feast of peace-offerings, for today my oaths have been effected.
[7:15] So I came out in the hope of meeting you, looking for you with care, and now I have you.
[7:16] My bed is covered with cushions of needlework, with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt;
[7:17] I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices.
[7:18] Come, let us take our pleasure in love till the morning, having joy in love's delights.
[7:19] For the master of the house is away on a long journey:
[7:20] He has taken a bag of money with him; he is coming back at the full moon.
[7:21] With her fair words she overcame him, forcing him with her smooth lips.
[7:22] The simple man goes after her, like an ox going to its death, like a roe pulled by a cord;
[7:23] Like a bird falling into a net; with no thought that his life is in danger, till an arrow goes into his side.
[7:24] So now, my sons, give ear to me; give attention to the sayings of my mouth;
[7:25] Let not your heart be turned to her ways, do not go wandering in her footsteps.
[7:26] For those wounded and made low by her are great in number; and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army.
[7:27] Her house is the way to the underworld, going down to the rooms of death.

[41:1] He is so cruel that no one is ready to go against him. Who then is able to keep his place before me?
[41:2] Who ever went against me, and got the better of me? There is no one under heaven!
[41:3] I will not keep quiet about the parts of his body, or about his power, and the strength of his frame.
[41:4] Who has ever taken off his outer skin? who may come inside his inner coat of iron?
[41:5] Who has made open the doors of his face? Fear is round about his teeth.
[41:6] His back is made of lines of plates, joined tight together, one against the other, like a stamp.
[41:7] One is so near to the other that no air may come between them.
[41:8] They take a grip of one another; they are joined together, so that they may not be parted.
[41:9] His sneezings give out flames, and his eyes are like the eyes of the dawn.
[41:10] Out of his mouth go burning lights, and flames of fire are jumping up.
[41:11] Smoke comes out of his nose, like a pot boiling on the fire.
[41:12] His breath puts fire to coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
[41:13] Strength is in his neck, and fear goes dancing before him.
[41:14] The plates of his flesh are joined together, fixed, and not to be moved.
[41:15] His heart is as strong as a stone, hard as the lower crushing-stone.
[41:16] When he gets ready for the fight, the strong are overcome with fear.
[41:17] The sword may come near him but is not able to go through him; the spear, or the arrow, or the sharp-pointed iron.
[41:18] Iron is to him as dry grass, and brass as soft wood.
[41:19] The arrow is not able to put him to flight: stones are no more to him than dry stems.
[41:20] A thick stick is no better than a leaf of grass, and he makes sport of the onrush of the spear.
[41:21] Under him are sharp edges of broken pots: as if he was pulling a grain-crushing instrument over the wet earth.
[41:22] The deep is boiling like a pot of spices, and the sea like a perfume-vessel.
[41:23] After him his way is shining, so that the deep seems white.
[41:24] On earth there is not another like him, who is made without fear.
[41:25] Everything which is high goes in fear of him; he is king over all the sons of pride.

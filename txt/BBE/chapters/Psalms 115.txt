[115:1] Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name let glory be given, because of your mercy and your unchanging faith.
[115:2] Why may the nations say, Where is now their God?
[115:3] But our God is in heaven: he has done whatever was pleasing to him.
[115:4] Their images are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
[115:5] They have mouths, but no voice; they have eyes, but they see not;
[115:6] They have ears, but no hearing; they have noses, but no sense of smell;
[115:7] They have hands without feeling, and feet without power of walking; and no sound comes from their throat.
[115:8] Those who make them are like them; and so is everyone who puts his faith in them.
[115:9] O Israel, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.
[115:10] O house of Aaron, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.
[115:11] You worshippers of the Lord, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.
[115:12] The Lord has kept us in mind and will give us his blessing; he will send blessings on the house of Israel and on the house of Aaron.
[115:13] He will send blessings on the worshippers of the Lord, on the small and on the great.
[115:14] May the Lord give you and your children still greater increase.
[115:15] May you have the blessing of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
[115:16] The heavens are the Lord's; but the earth he has given to the children of men.
[115:17] The dead do not give praise to the Lord; or those who go down to the underworld.
[115:18] But we will give praise to the Lord now and for ever. Praise be to the Lord.

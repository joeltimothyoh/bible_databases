[85:1] &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of the sons of Korah.&gt; Lord, you were good to your land: changing the fate of Jacob.
[85:2] The wrongdoing of your people had forgiveness; all their sin had been covered. (Selah.)
[85:3] You were no longer angry: you were turned from the heat of your wrath.
[85:4] Come back to us, O God of our salvation, and be angry with us no longer.
[85:5] Will you go on being angry with us for ever? will you keep your wrath against us through all the long generations?
[85:6] Will you not give us life again, so that your people may be glad in you?
[85:7] Let us see your mercy, O Lord, and give us your salvation.
[85:8] I will give ear to the voice of the Lord; for he will say words of peace to his people and to his saints; but let them not go back to their foolish ways.
[85:9] Truly, his salvation is near to his worshippers; so that glory may be in our land.
[85:10] Mercy and faith have come together; righteousness and peace have given one another a kiss.
[85:11] Faith comes up from the earth like a plant; righteousness is looking down from heaven.
[85:12] The Lord will give what is good; and our land will give its increase.
[85:13] Righteousness will go before him, making a way for his footsteps.

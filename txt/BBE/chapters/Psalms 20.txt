[20:1] &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; May the Lord give ear to you in the day of trouble; may you be placed on high by the name of the God of Jacob;
[20:2] May he send you help from the holy place, and give you strength from Zion;
[20:3] May he keep all your offerings in mind, and be pleased with the fat of your burned offerings; (Selah.)
[20:4] May he give you your heart's desire, and put all your purposes into effect.
[20:5] We will be glad in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will put up our flags: may the Lord give you all your requests.
[20:6] Now am I certain that the Lord gives salvation to his king; he will give him an answer from his holy heaven with the strength of salvation in his right hand.
[20:7] Some put their faith in carriages and some in horses; but we will be strong in the name of the Lord our God.
[20:8] They are bent down and made low; but we have been lifted up.
[20:9] Come to our help, Lord: let the king give ear to our cry.

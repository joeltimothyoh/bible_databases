[40:1] Then the Lord made answer to Job out of the storm-wind, and said,
[40:2] Get your strength together like a man of war: I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers.
[40:3] Will you even make my right of no value? will you say that I am wrong in order to make clear that you are right?
[40:4] Have you an arm like God? have you a voice of thunder like his?
[40:5] Put on the ornaments of your pride; be clothed with glory and power:
[40:6] Let your wrath be overflowing; let your eyes see all the sons of pride, and make them low.
[40:7] Send destruction on all who are lifted up, pulling down the sinners from their places.
[40:8] Let them be covered together in the dust; let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld.
[40:9] Then I will give praise to you, saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation.
[40:10] See now the Great Beast, whom I made, even as I made you; he takes grass for food, like the ox.
[40:11] His strength is in his body, and his force in the muscles of his stomach.
[40:12] His tail is curving like a cedar; the muscles of his legs are joined together.
[40:13] His bones are pipes of brass, his legs are like rods of iron.
[40:14] He is the chief of the ways of God, made by him for his pleasure.
[40:15] He takes the produce of the mountains, where all the beasts of the field are at play.
[40:16] He takes his rest under the trees of the river, and in the pool, under the shade of the water-plants.
[40:17] He is covered by the branches of the trees; the grasses of the stream are round him.
[40:18] Truly, if the river is overflowing, it gives him no cause for fear; he has no sense of danger, even if Jordan is rushing against his mouth.
[40:19] Will anyone take him when he is on the watch, or put metal teeth through his nose?
[40:20] Is it possible for Leviathan to be pulled out with a fish-hook, or for a hook to be put through the bone of his mouth?
[40:21] Will you put a cord into his nose, or take him away with a cord round his tongue?
[40:22] Will he make prayers to you, or say soft words to you?
[40:23] Will he make an agreement with you, so that you may take him as a servant for ever?
[40:24] Will you make sport with him, as with a bird? or put him in chains for your young women?
[40:25] Will the fishermen make profit out of him? will they have him cut up for the traders?
[40:26] Will you put sharp-pointed irons into his skin, or fish-spears into his head?
[40:27] Only put your hand on him, and see what a fight you will have; you will not do it again!
[40:28] Truly, the hope of his attacker is false; he is overcome even on seeing him!

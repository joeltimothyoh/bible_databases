[122:1] &lt;A Song of the going up. Of David.&gt; I was glad because they said to me, We will go into the house of the Lord.
[122:2] At last our feet were inside your doors, O Jerusalem.
[122:3] O Jerusalem, you are like a town which is well joined together;
[122:4] To which the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Lord, for a witness to Israel, to give praise to the name of the Lord.
[122:5] For there seats for the judges were placed, even the rulers' seats of the line of David.
[122:6] O make prayers for the peace of Jerusalem; may they whose love is given to you do well.
[122:7] May peace be inside your walls, and wealth in your noble houses.
[122:8] Because of my brothers and friends, I will now say, Let peace be with you.
[122:9] Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will be working for your good.

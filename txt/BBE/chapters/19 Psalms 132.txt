[132:1] &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; Lord, give thought to David, and to all his troubles;
[132:2] How he made an oath to the Lord, and gave his word to the great God of Jacob, saying,
[132:3] Truly, I will not come into my house, or go to my bed,
[132:4] I will not give sleep to my eyes, or rest to my eyeballs,
[132:5] Till I have got a place for the Lord, a resting-place for the great God of Jacob.
[132:6] We had news of it at Ephrathah: we came to it in the fields of the wood.
[132:7] Let us go into his tent; let us give worship at his feet.
[132:8] Come back, O Lord, to your resting-place; you and the ark of your strength.
[132:9] Let your priests be clothed with righteousness; and let your saints give cries of joy.
[132:10] Because of your servant David, do not give up your king.
[132:11] The Lord gave a true oath to David, which he will not take back, saying, I will give your kingdom to the fruit of your body.
[132:12] If your children keep my word, and the teachings which I will give them, their children will be rulers of your kingdom for ever.
[132:13] For the Lord's heart is on Zion, desiring it for his resting-place.
[132:14] This is my rest for ever: here will I ever be; for this is my desire.
[132:15] My blessing will be on her food; and her poor will be full of bread.
[132:16] Her priests will be clothed with salvation; and her saints will give cries of joy.
[132:17] There I will make the horn of David fertile: I have made ready a light for my king.
[132:18] His haters will be clothed with shame; but I will make his crown shining.

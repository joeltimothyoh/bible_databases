[145:1] &lt;A Song of praise. Of David.&gt; Let me give glory to you, O God, my King; and blessing to your name for ever and ever.
[145:2] Every day will I give you blessing, praising your name for ever and ever.
[145:3] Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; his power may never be searched out.
[145:4] One generation after another will give praise to your great acts, and make clear the operation of your strength.
[145:5] My thoughts will be of the honour and glory of your rule, and of the wonder of your works.
[145:6] Men will be talking of the power and fear of your acts; I will give word of your glory.
[145:7] Their sayings will be full of the memory of all your mercy, and they will make songs of your righteousness.
[145:8] The Lord is full of grace and pity; not quickly angry, but great in mercy.
[145:9] The Lord is good to all men; and his mercies are over all his works.
[145:10] All the works of your hands give praise to you, O Lord; and your saints give you blessing.
[145:11] Their words will be of the glory of your kingdom, and their talk of your strength;
[145:12] So that the sons of men may have knowledge of his acts of power, and of the great glory of his kingdom.
[145:13] Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and your rule is through all generations.
[145:14] The Lord is the support of all who are crushed, and the lifter up of all who are bent down.
[145:15] The eyes of all men are waiting for you; and you give them their food in its time.
[145:16] By the opening of your hand, every living thing has its desire in full measure.
[145:17] The Lord is upright in all his ways, and kind in all his works.
[145:18] The Lord is near all those who give honour to his name; even to all who give honour to him with true hearts.
[145:19] To his worshippers, he will give their desire; their cry comes to his ears, and he gives them salvation.
[145:20] The Lord will keep all his worshippers from danger; but he will send destruction on all sinners.
[145:21] My mouth will give praise to the Lord; let all flesh be blessing his holy name for ever and ever.

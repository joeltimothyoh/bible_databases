[39:1] Do you go after food for the she-lion, or get meat so that the young lions may have enough,
[39:2] When they are stretched out in their holes, and are waiting in the brushwood?
[39:3] Who gives in the evening the meat he is searching for, when his young ones are crying to God; when the young lions with loud noise go wandering after their food?
[39:4] Have you knowledge of the rock-goats? or do you see the roes giving birth to their young?
[39:5] Is the number of their months fixed by you? or is the time when they give birth ordered by you?
[39:6] They are bent down, they give birth to their young, they let loose the fruit of their body.
[39:7] Their young ones are strong, living in the open country; they go out and do not come back again.
[39:8] Who has let the ass of the fields go free? or made loose the bands of the loud-voiced beast?
[39:9] To whom I have given the waste land for a heritage, and the salt land as a living-place.
[39:10] He makes sport of the noise of the town; the voice of the driver does not come to his ears;
[39:11] He goes looking for his grass-lands in the mountains, searching out every green thing.
[39:12] Will the ox of the mountains be your servant? or is his night's resting-place by your food-store?
[39:13] Will he be pulling your plough with cords, turning up the valleys after you?
[39:14] Will you put your faith in him, because his strength is great? will you give the fruit of your work into his care?
[39:15] Will you be looking for him to come back, and get in your seed to the crushing-floor?
[39:16] Is the wing of the ostrich feeble, or is it because she has no feathers,
[39:17] That she puts her eggs on the earth, warming them in the dust,
[39:18] Without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot, and broken by the beasts of the field?
[39:19] She is cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; her work is to no purpose; she has no fear.
[39:20] For God has taken wisdom from her mind, and given her no measure of knowledge.
[39:21] When she is shaking her wings on high, she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him.
[39:22] Do you give strength to the horse? is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power?
[39:23] Is it through you that he is shaking like a locust, in the pride of his loud-sounding breath?
[39:24] He is stamping with joy in the valley; he makes sport of fear.
[39:25] In his strength he goes out against the arms of war, turning not away from the sword.
[39:26] The bow is sounding against him; he sees the shining point of spear and arrow.
[39:27] Shaking with passion, he is biting the earth; he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn;
[39:28] When it comes to his ears he says, Aha! He is smelling the fight from far off, and hearing the thunder of the captains, and the war-cries.
[39:29] Is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight, stretching out his wings to the south?
[39:30] Or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up, and makes his resting-place on high?
[39:31] On the rock is his house, and on the mountain-top his strong place.
[39:32] From there he is watching for food; his eye sees it far off.
[39:33] His young have blood for their drink, and where the dead bodies are, there is he to be seen.
[39:34] ...
[39:35] Will he who is protesting give teaching to the Ruler of all? Let him who has arguments to put forward against God give an answer.
[39:36] And Job said in answer to the Lord,
[39:37] Truly, I am of no value; what answer may I give to you? I will put my hand on my mouth.
[39:38] I have said once, and even twice, what was in my mind, but I will not do so again.

[3:1] I am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his wrath.
[3:2] By him I have been made to go in the dark where there is no light.
[3:3] Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day.
[3:4] My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken.
[3:5] He has put up a wall against me, shutting me in with bitter sorrow.
[3:6] He has kept me in dark places, like those who have been long dead.
[3:7] He has put a wall round me, so that I am not able to go out; he has made great the weight of my chain.
[3:8] Even when I send up a cry for help, he keeps my prayer shut out.
[3:9] He has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways, he has made my roads twisted.
[3:10] He is like a bear waiting for me, like a lion in secret places.
[3:11] By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste.
[3:12] With his bow bent, he has made me the mark for his arrows.
[3:13] He has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body.
[3:14] I have become the sport of all the peoples; I am their song all the day.
[3:15] He has made my life nothing but pain, he has given me the bitter root in full measure.
[3:16] By him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones, and I am bent low in the dust.
[3:17] My soul is sent far away from peace, I have no more memory of good.
[3:18] And I said, My strength is cut off, and my hope from the Lord.
[3:19] Keep in mind my trouble and my wandering, the bitter root and the poison.
[3:20] My soul still keeps the memory of them; and is bent down in me.
[3:21] This I keep in mind, and because of this I have hope.
[3:22] It is through the Lord's love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit.
[3:23] They are new every morning; great is your good faith.
[3:24] I said to myself, The Lord is my heritage; and because of this I will have hope in him.
[3:25] The Lord is good to those who are waiting for him, to the soul which is looking for him.
[3:26] It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord.
[3:27] It is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young.
[3:28] Let him be seated by himself, saying nothing, because he has put it on him.
[3:29] Let him put his mouth in the dust, if by chance there may be hope.
[3:30] Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows; let him be full of shame.
[3:31] For the Lord does not give a man up for ever.
[3:32] For though he sends grief, still he will have pity in the full measure of his love.
[3:33] For he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men.
[3:34] In a man's crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
[3:35] In his turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High.
[3:36] In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure.
[3:37] Who is able to say a thing, and give effect to it, if it has not been ordered by the Lord?
[3:38] Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High?
[3:39] What protest may a living man make, even a man about the punishment of his sin?
[3:40] Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord;
[3:41] Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens.
[3:42] We have done wrong and gone against your law; we have not had your forgiveness.
[3:43] Covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us, cutting us off without pity;
[3:44] Covering yourself with a cloud, so that prayer may not get through.
[3:45] You have made us like waste and that for which there is no use, among the peoples.
[3:46] The mouths of all our haters are open wide against us.
[3:47] Fear and deep waters have come on us, wasting and destruction.
[3:48] Rivers of water are running down from my eyes, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
[3:49] My eyes are streaming without stopping, they have no rest,
[3:50] Till the Lord's eye is turned on me, till he sees my trouble from heaven.
[3:51] The Lord is unkind to my soul, more than all the daughters of my town.
[3:52] They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird;
[3:53] They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones.
[3:54] Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off.
[3:55] I was making prayer to your name, O Lord, out of the lowest prison.
[3:56] My voice came to you; let not your ear be shut to my breathing, to my cry.
[3:57] You came near in the day when I made my prayer to you: you said, Have no fear.
[3:58] O Lord, you have taken up the cause of my soul, you have made my life safe.
[3:59] O Lord, you have seen my wrong; be judge in my cause.
[3:60] You have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me, and all their designs against me.
[3:61] Their bitter words have come to your ears, O Lord, and all their designs against me;
[3:62] The lips of those who came up against me, and their thoughts against me all the day.
[3:63] Take note of them when they are seated, and when they get up; I am their song.
[3:64] You will give them their reward, O Lord, answering to the work of their hands.
[3:65] You will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them.
[3:66] You will go after them in wrath, and put an end to them from under the heavens of the Lord.

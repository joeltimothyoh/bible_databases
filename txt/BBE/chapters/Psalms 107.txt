[107:1] O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.
[107:2] Let those whose cause the Lord has taken up say so, his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters;
[107:3] Making them come together out of all the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
[107:4] They were wandering in the waste places; they saw no way to a resting-place.
[107:5] Their souls became feeble for need of food and drink.
[107:6] Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles;
[107:7] Guiding them in the right way, so that they might come into the town of their resting-place.
[107:8] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!
[107:9] He gives its desire to the unresting soul, so that it is full of good things.
[107:10] Those who were in the dark, in the black night, in chains of sorrow and iron;
[107:11] Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High:
[107:12] So that he made their hearts weighted down with grief; they were falling, and had no helper.
[107:13] Then they sent up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles.
[107:14] He took them out of the dark and the black night, and all their chains were broken.
[107:15] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!
[107:16] The doors of brass are broken by his arm, and the bands of iron are cut in two.
[107:17] Foolish men, because of their sins, and because of their wrongdoing, are troubled;
[107:18] They are disgusted by all food, and they come near to the doors of death.
[107:19] Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.
[107:20] He sent his word and made them well, and kept them safe from the underworld.
[107:21] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!
[107:22] Let them make offerings of praise, giving news of his works with cries of joy.
[107:23] Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters;
[107:24] They see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.
[107:25] For at his word comes up the storm-wind, lifting high the waves.
[107:26] The sailors go up to heaven, and down into the deep; their souls are wasted because of their trouble.
[107:27] They are turned here and there, rolling like a man who is full of wine; and all their wisdom comes to nothing.
[107:28] Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.
[107:29] He makes the storm into a calm, so that the waves are at peace.
[107:30] Then they are glad, because the sea is quiet, and he takes them to the harbour of their desire.
[107:31] Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!
[107:32] Let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people, and praise among the chiefs.
[107:33] He makes rivers into waste places, and springs of water into a dry land;
[107:34] He makes a fertile country into a salt waste, because of the sins of those who are living there.
[107:35] He makes a waste land into a place of water, and a dry land into water-springs.
[107:36] And there he gives the poor a resting-place, so that they may make themselves a town;
[107:37] And put seed in the fields and make vine-gardens, to give them fruit.
[107:38] He gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly, and their cattle do not become less.
[107:39] And when they are made low, and crushed by trouble and sorrow,
[107:40] He puts an end to the pride of kings, and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way.
[107:41] But he puts the poor man on high from his troubles, and gives him families like a flock.
[107:42] The upright see it and are glad: the mouth of the sinner is stopped.
[107:43] Let the wise give thought to these things, and see the mercies of the Lord.

[3:1] Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth,
[3:2] Job made answer and said,
[3:3] Let destruction take the day of my birth, and the night on which it was said, A man child has come into the world.
[3:4] That day--let it be dark; let not God take note of it from on high, and let not the light be shining on it;
[3:5] Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves; let it be covered with a cloud; let the dark shades of day send fear on it.
[3:6] That night--let the thick dark take it; let it not have joy among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
[3:7] As for that night, let it have no fruit; let no voice of joy be sounded in it;
[3:8] Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day; who are ready to make Leviathan awake.
[3:9] Let its morning stars be dark; let it be looking for light, but may it not have any; let it not see the eyes of the dawn.
[3:10] Because it did not keep the doors of my mother's body shut, so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes.
[3:11] Why did death not take me when I came out of my mother's body, why did I not, when I came out, give up my last breath?
[3:12] Why did the knees take me, or why the breasts that they might give me milk?
[3:13] For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace,
[3:14] With kings and the wise ones of the earth, who put up great houses for themselves;
[3:15] Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver;
[3:16] Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence; like young children who have not seen the light.
[3:17] There the passions of the evil are over, and those whose strength has come to an end have rest.
[3:18] There the prisoners are at peace together; the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears.
[3:19] The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master.
[3:20] Why does he give light to him who is in trouble, and life to the bitter in soul;
[3:21] To those whose desire is for death, but it comes not; who are searching for it more than for secret wealth;
[3:22] Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place;
[3:23] To a man whose way is veiled, and who is shut in by God?
[3:24] In place of my food I have grief, and cries of sorrow come from me like water.
[3:25] For I have a fear and it comes on me, and my heart is greatly troubled.
[3:26] I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me.

[121:1] &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; My eyes are lifted up to the hills: O where will my help come from?
[121:2] Your help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
[121:3] May he not let your foot be moved: no need of sleep has he who keeps you.
[121:4] See, the eyes of Israel's keeper will not be shut in sleep.
[121:5] The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[121:6] You will not be touched by the sun in the day, or by the moon at night.
[121:7] The Lord will keep you safe from all evil; he will take care of your soul.
[121:8] The Lord will keep watch over your going out and your coming in, from this time and for ever.

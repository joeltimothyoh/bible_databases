[108:1] &lt;A Song. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O God, my heart is fixed; I will make songs and melody, even with my glory.
[108:2] Give out your sounds, O corded instruments: the dawn will be awaking with my song.
[108:3] I will give you praise, O Lord, among the peoples; I will make melody to you among the nations.
[108:4] For your mercy is higher than the heavens: and your unchanging faith than the clouds.
[108:5] Be lifted up, O God, higher than the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
[108:6] Let your right hand be stretched out for salvation, and give me an answer, so that your loved ones may be safe from danger.
[108:7] This is the word of the holy God: I will be glad; I will make Shechem a heritage, measuring out the valley of Succoth.
[108:8] Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;
[108:9] Moab is my washpot; on Edom is the resting-place of my shoe; over Philistia will I send out a glad cry.
[108:10] Who will take me into the strong town? who will be my guide into Edom?
[108:11] Have you not sent us away from you, O God? and you go not out with our armies.
[108:12] Give us help in our trouble; for there is no help in man.
[108:13] With God we will do great things; for by him will our haters be crushed underfoot.

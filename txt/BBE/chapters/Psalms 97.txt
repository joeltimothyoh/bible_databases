[97:1] The Lord is King, let the earth have joy; let all the sea-lands be glad.
[97:2] Dark clouds are round him; his kingdom is based on righteousness and right judging.
[97:3] Fire goes before him, burning up all those who are against him round about.
[97:4] His bright flames give light to the world; the earth saw it with fear.
[97:5] The mountains became like wax at the coming of the Lord, at the coming of the Lord of all the earth.
[97:6] The heavens gave out the news of his righteousness, and all the people saw his glory.
[97:7] Shamed be all those who give worship to images, and take pride in false gods; give him worship, all you gods.
[97:8] Zion gave ear and was glad; and the daughters of Judah were full of joy, because of your decisions, O Lord.
[97:9] For you, Lord, are most high over the earth; you are lifted up over all other gods.
[97:10] You who are lovers of the Lord, be haters of evil; he keeps the souls of his saints; he takes them out of the hand of sinners.
[97:11] Light is shining on the lovers of righteousness, and for the upright in heart there is joy.
[97:12] Be glad in the Lord, you upright men; praising the memory of his holy name.

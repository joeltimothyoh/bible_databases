[9:1] Wisdom has made her house, putting up her seven pillars.
[9:2] She has put her fat beasts to death; her wine is mixed, her table is ready.
[9:3] She has sent out her women-servants; her voice goes out to the highest places of the town, saying,
[9:4] Whoever is simple, let him come in here; and to him who has no sense, she says:
[9:5] Come, take of my bread, and of my wine which is mixed.
[9:6] Give up the simple ones and have life, and go in the way of knowledge.
[9:7] He who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself; he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name.
[9:8] Do not say sharp words to a man of pride, or he will have hate for you; make them clear to a wise man, and you will be dear to him.
[9:9] Give teaching to a wise man, and he will become wiser; give training to an upright man, and his learning will be increased.
[9:10] The fear of the Lord is the start of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One gives a wise mind
[9:11] For by me your days will be increased, and the years of your life will be long.
[9:12] If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if your heart is full of pride, you only will have the pain of it.
[9:13] The foolish woman is full of noise; she has no sense at all.
[9:14] Seated at the door of her house, in the high places of the town,
[9:15] Crying out to those who go by, going straight on their way, she says:
[9:16] Whoever is simple, let him come in here: and to him who is without sense, she says:
[9:17] Drink taken without right is sweet, and food in secret is pleasing.
[9:18] But he does not see that the dead are there, that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld.

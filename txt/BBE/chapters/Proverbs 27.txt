[27:1] Do not make a noise about tomorrow, for you are not certain what a day's outcome may be.
[27:2] Let another man give you praise, and not your mouth; one who is strange to you, and not your lips.
[27:3] A stone has great weight, and sand is crushing; but the wrath of the foolish is of greater weight than these.
[27:4] Wrath is cruel, and angry feeling an overflowing stream; but who does not give way before envy?
[27:5] Better is open protest than love kept secret.
[27:6] The wounds of a friend are given in good faith, but the kisses of a hater are false.
[27:7] The full man has no use for honey, but to the man in need of food every bitter thing is sweet.
[27:8] Like a bird wandering from the place of her eggs is a man wandering from his station.
[27:9] Oil and perfume make glad the heart, and the wise suggestion of a friend is sweet to the soul.
[27:10] Do not give up your friend and your father's friend; and do not go into your brother's house in the day of your trouble: better is a neighbour who is near than a brother far off.
[27:11] My son, be wise and make my heart glad, so that I may give back an answer to him who puts me to shame.
[27:12] The sharp man sees the evil and takes cover: the simple go straight on and get into trouble.
[27:13] Take a man's clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man, and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men.
[27:14] He who gives a blessing to his friend with a loud voice, getting up early in the morning, will have it put to his account as a curse.
[27:15] Like an unending dropping on a day of rain is a bitter-tongued woman.
[27:16] He who keeps secret the secret of his friend, will get himself a name for good faith.
[27:17] Iron makes iron sharp; so a man makes sharp his friend.
[27:18] Whoever keeps a fig-tree will have its fruit; and the servant waiting on his master will be honoured.
[27:19] Like face looking at face in water, so are the hearts of men to one another.
[27:20] The underworld and Abaddon are never full, and the eyes of man have never enough.
[27:21] The heating-pot is for silver and the oven-fire for gold, and a man is measured by what he is praised for.
[27:22] Even if a foolish man is crushed with a hammer in a vessel among crushed grain, still his foolish ways will not go from him.
[27:23] Take care to have knowledge about the condition of your flocks, looking well after your herds;
[27:24] For wealth is not for ever, and money does not go on for all generations.
[27:25] The grass comes up and the young grass is seen, and the mountain plants are got in.
[27:26] The lambs are for your clothing, and the he-goats make the value of a field:
[27:27] There will be goats' milk enough for your food, and for the support of your servant-girls.

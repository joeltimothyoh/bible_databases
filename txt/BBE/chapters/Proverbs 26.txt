[26:1] Like snow in summer and rain when the grain is being cut, so honour is not natural for the foolish.
[26:2] As the sparrow in her wandering and the swallow in her flight, so the curse does not come without a cause.
[26:3] A whip for the horse, a mouth-bit for the ass, and a rod for the back of the foolish.
[26:4] Do not give to the foolish man a foolish answer, or you will be like him.
[26:5] Give a foolish man a foolish answer, or he will seem wise to himself.
[26:6] He who sends news by the hand of a foolish man is cutting off his feet and drinking in damage.
[26:7] The legs of one who has no power of walking are hanging loose; so is a wise saying in the mouth of the foolish.
[26:8] Giving honour to a foolish man is like attempting to keep a stone fixed in a cord.
[26:9] Like a thorn which goes up into the hand of a man overcome by drink, so is a wise saying in the mouth of a foolish man.
[26:10] Like an archer wounding all who go by, is a foolish man overcome by drink.
[26:11] Like a dog going back to the food which he has not been able to keep down, is the foolish man doing his foolish acts over again.
[26:12] Have you seen a man who seems to himself to be wise? There is more hope for the foolish than for him.
[26:13] The hater of work says, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.
[26:14] A door is turned on its pillar, and the hater of work on his bed.
[26:15] The hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin: lifting it again to his mouth is a weariness to him.
[26:16] The hater of work seems to himself wiser than seven men who are able to give an answer with good sense.
[26:17] He who gets mixed up in a fight which is not his business, is like one who takes a dog by the ears while it is going by.
[26:18] As one who is off his head sends about flaming sticks and arrows of death,
[26:19] So is the man who gets the better of his neighbour by deceit, and says, Am I not doing so in sport?
[26:20] Without wood, the fire goes out; and where there is no secret talk, argument is ended.
[26:21] Like breath on coals and wood on fire, so a man given to argument gets a fight started.
[26:22] The words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food, they go down into the inner parts of the stomach.
[26:23] Smooth lips and an evil heart are like a vessel of earth plated with silver waste.
[26:24] With his lips the hater makes things seem what they are not, but deceit is stored up inside him;
[26:25] When he says fair words, have no belief in him; for in his heart are seven evils:
[26:26] Though his hate is covered with deceit, his sin will be seen openly before the meeting of the people.
[26:27] He who makes a hole in the earth will himself go falling into it: and on him by whom a stone is rolled the stone will come back again.
[26:28] A false tongue has hate for those who have clean hearts, and a smooth mouth is a cause of falling.

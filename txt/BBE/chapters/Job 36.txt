[36:1] And Elihu went on to say,
[36:2] Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God.
[36:3] I will get my knowledge from far, and I will give righteousness to my Maker.
[36:4] For truly my words are not false; one who has all knowledge is talking with you.
[36:5] Truly, God gives up the hard-hearted, and will not give life to the sinner.
[36:6] His eyes are ever on the upright, and he gives to the crushed their right;
[36:7] Lifting them up to the seat of kings, and making them safe for ever.
[36:8] And if they have been prisoned in chains, and taken in cords of trouble,
[36:9] Then he makes clear to them what they have done, even their evil works in which they have taken pride.
[36:10] Their ear is open to his teaching, and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil.
[36:11] If they give ear to his voice, and do his word, then he gives them long life, and years full of pleasure.
[36:12] But if not, they come to their end, and give up their breath without knowledge.
[36:13] Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts; they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners.
[36:14] They come to their end while they are still young, their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods.
[36:15] He makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation, opening their ears by their trouble.
[36:16] ...
[36:17] ...
[36:18] ...
[36:19] ...
[36:20] ...
[36:21] Take care not to be turned to sin, for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow.
[36:22] Truly God is lifted up in strength; who is a ruler like him?
[36:23] Who ever gave orders to him, or said to him, You have done wrong?
[36:24] See that you give praise to his work, about which men make songs.
[36:25] All people are looking on it; man sees it from far.
[36:26] Truly, God is great, greater than all our knowledge; the number of his years may not be searched out.
[36:27] For he takes up the drops from the sea; he sends them through his mist as rain,
[36:28] Flowing down from the sky, and dropping on the peoples.
[36:29] And who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out, or of the thunders of his tent?
[36:30] See, he is stretching out his mist, covering the tops of the mountains with it.
[36:31] For by these he gives food to the peoples, and bread in full measure.
[36:32] He takes the light in his hands, sending it against the mark.
[36:33] The thunder makes clear his passion, and the storm gives news of his wrath.

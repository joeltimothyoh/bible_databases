[60:1] &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Shushan-eduth. Michtam. Of David. For teaching. When he was fighting against Aram-naharaim and Aramzobah, when Joab came back, and put twelve thousand of the Edomites to death, in the Valley of Salt.&gt; God, you have put us away from you, you have sent us in all directions, you have been angry; O be turned to us again.
[60:2] By the power of your hand the earth is shaking and broken; make it strong again, for it is moved.
[60:3] You have made the people see hard times; you have given us the wine of shaking for our drink.
[60:4] Give a safe place to those who have fear of you, where they may go in flight from before the bow. (Selah.)
[60:5] So that your loved ones may be made safe, let your right hand be my salvation, and give me an answer.
[60:6] God has said in his holy place, I will be glad: I will make a division of Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will be measured out.
[60:7] Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;
[60:8] Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I put out my shoe; over Philistia will a glad cry be sounded.
[60:9] Who will take me into the strong town? who will be my guide into Edom?
[60:10] Have not you put us away, O God? and you have not gone out with our armies.
[60:11] Give us help in our trouble; for there is no help in man.
[60:12] Through God we will do great things, for through him our haters will be crushed under our feet.

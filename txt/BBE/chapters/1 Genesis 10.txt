[10:1] Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters
[10:2] The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.
[10:3] And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
[10:4] And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, the Kittim and the Dodanim.
[10:5] From these came the nations of the sea-lands, with their different families and languages.
[10:6] And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.
[10:7] And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
[10:8] And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who was the first of the great men of the earth.
[10:9] He was a very great bowman, so that there is a saying, Like Nimrod, a very great bowman.
[10:10] And at the first, his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
[10:11] From that land he went out into Assyria, building Nineveh with its wide streets and Calah,
[10:12] And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which is a very great town.
[10:13] And Mizraim was the father of the Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim;
[10:14] And Pathrusim and Casluhim and Caphtorim, from whom came the Philistines.
[10:15] And Canaan was the father of Zidon, who was his oldest son, and Heth,
[10:16] And the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite,
[10:17] And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite,
[10:18] And the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; after that the families of the Canaanites went far and wide in all directions;
[10:19] Their country stretching from Zidon to Gaza, in the direction of Gerar; and to Lasha, in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim.
[10:20] All these, with their different families, languages, lands, and nations, are the offspring of Ham.
[10:21] And Shem, the older brother of Japheth, the father of the children of Eber, had other sons in addition.
[10:22] These are the sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
[10:23] And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
[10:24] And Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber.
[10:25] And Eber had two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate; and his brother's name was Joktan.
[10:26] And Joktan was the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
[10:27] And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah
[10:28] And Obal and Abimael and Sheba
[10:29] And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
[10:30] And their country was from Mesha, in the direction of Sephar, the mountain of the east.
[10:31] These, with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations, are the offspring of Shem.
[10:32] These are the families of the sons of Noah, in the order of their generations and their nations: from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters.

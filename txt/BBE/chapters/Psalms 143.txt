[143:1] &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Let my prayer come to you, O Lord; give ear to my requests for your grace; keep faith with me, and give me an answer in your righteousness;
[143:2] Let not your servant come before you to be judged; for no man living is upright in your eyes.
[143:3] The evil man has gone after my soul; my life is crushed down to the earth: he has put me in the dark, like those who have long been dead.
[143:4] Because of this my spirit is overcome; and my heart is full of fear.
[143:5] I keep in mind the early days of the past, giving thought to all your acts, even to the work of your hands.
[143:6] My hands are stretched out to you: my soul is turned to you, like a land in need of water. (Selah.)
[143:7] Be quick in answering me, O Lord, for the strength of my spirit is gone: let me see your face, so that I may not be like those who go down into the underworld.
[143:8] Let the story of your mercy come to me in the morning, for my hope is in you: give me knowledge of the way in which I am to go; for my soul is lifted up to you.
[143:9] O Lord, take me out of the hands of my haters; my soul is waiting for you.
[143:10] Give me teaching so that I may do your pleasure; for you are my God: let your good Spirit be my guide into the land of righteousness.
[143:11] Give me life, O Lord, because of your name; in your righteousness take my soul out of trouble.
[143:12] And in your mercy put an end to my haters, and send destruction on all those who are against my soul; for I am your servant.

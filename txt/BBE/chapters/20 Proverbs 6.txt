[6:1] My son, if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour, or given your word for another,
[6:2] You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth, the sayings of your lips have overcome you.
[6:3] Do this, my son, and make yourself free, because you have come into the power of your neighbour; go without waiting, and make a strong request to your neighbour.
[6:4] Give no sleep to your eyes, or rest to them;
[6:5] Make yourself free, like the roe from the hand of the archer, and the bird from him who puts a net for her.
[6:6] Go to the ant, you hater of work; give thought to her ways and be wise:
[6:7] Having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
[6:8] She gets her meat in the summer, storing up food at the time of the grain-cutting.
[6:9] How long will you be sleeping, O hater of work? when will you get up from your sleep?
[6:10] A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep:
[6:11] Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man
[6:12] A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words;
[6:13] Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers;
[6:14] His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts.
[6:15] For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him.
[6:16] Six things are hated by the Lord; seven things are disgusting to him:
[6:17] Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause;
[6:18] A heart full of evil designs, feet which are quick in running after sin;
[6:19] A false witness, breathing out untrue words, and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers.
[6:20] My son, keep the rule of your father, and have in memory the teaching of your mother:
[6:21] Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck.
[6:22] In your walking, it will be your guide; when you are sleeping, it will keep watch over you; when you are awake, it will have talk with you.
[6:23] For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life.
[6:24] They will keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the strange woman.
[6:25] Let not your heart's desire go after her fair body; let not her eyes take you prisoner.
[6:26] For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread, but another man's wife goes after one's very life.
[6:27] May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing?
[6:28] Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned?
[6:29] So it is with him who goes in to his neighbour's wife; he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment.
[6:30] Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it:
[6:31] But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house.
[6:32] He who takes another man's wife is without all sense: he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul.
[6:33] Wounds will be his and loss of honour, and his shame may not be washed away.
[6:34] For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband; in the day of punishment he will have no mercy.
[6:35] He will not take any payment; and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased.

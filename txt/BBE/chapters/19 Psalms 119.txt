[119:1] &lt;ALEPH&gt; Happy are they who are without sin in their ways, walking in the law of the Lord.
[119:2] Happy are they who keep his unchanging word, searching after him with all their heart.
[119:3] They do no evil; they go in his ways.
[119:4] You have put your orders into our hearts, so that we might keep them with care.
[119:5] If only my ways were ordered so that I might keep your rules!
[119:6] Then I would not be put to shame, as long as I have respect for all your teaching.
[119:7] I will give you praise with an upright heart in learning your right decisions.
[119:8] I will keep your rules: O give me not up completely.
[119:9] &lt;BETH&gt; How may a young man make his way clean? by guiding it after your word.
[119:10] I have made search for you with all my heart: O let me not go wandering far from your teaching.
[119:11] I have kept your sayings secretly in my heart, so that I might do no sin against you.
[119:12] Praise be to you, O Lord: give me knowledge of your rules.
[119:13] With my lips have I made clear all the decisions of your mouth.
[119:14] I have taken as much delight in the way of your unchanging word, as in all wealth.
[119:15] I will give thought to your orders, and have respect for your ways.
[119:16] I will have delight in your rules; I will not let your word go out of my mind.
[119:17] &lt;GIMEL&gt; Give me, your servant, the reward of life, so that I may keep your word;
[119:18] Let my eyes be open to see the wonders of your law.
[119:19] I am living in a strange land: do not let your teachings be kept secret from me.
[119:20] My soul is broken with desire for your decisions at all times.
[119:21] Your hand has been against the men of pride, a curse is on those who go wandering out of your way.
[119:22] Take away from me shame and bitter words; for I have kept your unchanging word in my heart.
[119:23] Rulers make evil designs against me; but your servant gives thought to your rules.
[119:24] Your unchanging word is my delight, and the guide of my footsteps.
[119:25] &lt;DALETH&gt; My soul is joined to the dust: O give me life, in keeping with your word.
[119:26] I put the record of my ways before you, and you gave me an answer: O give me knowledge of your rules.
[119:27] Make the way of your orders clear to me; then my thoughts will be ever on your wonders.
[119:28] My soul is wasted with sorrow; give me strength again in keeping with your word
[119:29] Take from me every false way; and in mercy give me your law.
[119:30] I have taken the way of faith: I have kept your decisions before me.
[119:31] I have been true to your unchanging word; O Lord, do not put me to shame.
[119:32] I will go quickly in the way of your teaching, because you have given me a free heart.
[119:33] &lt;HE&gt; O Lord, let me see the way of your rules, and I will keep it to the end.
[119:34] Give me wisdom, so that I may keep your law; going after it with all my heart.
[119:35] Make me go in the way of your teachings; for they are my delight.
[119:36] Let my heart be turned to your unchanging word, and not to evil desire.
[119:37] Let my eyes be turned away from what is false; give me life in your ways.
[119:38] Give effect to your word to your servant, in whose heart is the fear of you.
[119:39] Take away the shame which is my fear; for your decisions are good.
[119:40] See how great is my desire for your orders: give me life in your righteousness.
[119:41] &lt;VAU&gt; Let your mercies come to me, O Lord, even your salvation, as you have said.
[119:42] So that I may have an answer for the man who would put me to shame; for I have faith in your word.
[119:43] Take not your true word quite out of my mouth; for I have put my hope in your decisions.
[119:44] So that I may keep your law for ever and ever;
[119:45] So that my way may be in a wide place: because my search has been for your orders.
[119:46] So that I may give knowledge of your unchanging word before kings, and not be put to shame.
[119:47] And so that I may take delight in your teachings, to which I have given my love.
[119:48] And so that my hands may be stretched out to you; and I will give thought to your rules.
[119:49] &lt;ZAIN&gt; Keep in mind your word to your servant, for on it has my hope been fixed.
[119:50] This is my comfort in my trouble; that your sayings have given me life.
[119:51] The men of pride have made great sport of me; but I have not been turned from your law.
[119:52] I have kept the memory of your decisions from times past, O Lord; and they have been my comfort.
[119:53] I am burning with wrath, because of the sinners who have given up your law.
[119:54] Your rules have been melodies to me, while I have been living in strange lands.
[119:55] I have given thought to your name in the night, O Lord, and have kept your law.
[119:56] This has been true of me, that I have kept your orders in my heart.
[119:57] &lt;CHETH&gt; The Lord is my heritage: I have said that I would be ruled by your words.
[119:58] I have given my mind to do your pleasure with all my heart; have mercy on me, as you have said.
[119:59] I gave thought to my steps, and my feet were turned into the way of your unchanging word.
[119:60] I was quick to do your orders, and let no time be wasted.
[119:61] The cords of evil-doers are round me; but I have kept in mind your law.
[119:62] In the middle of the night I will get up to give you praise, because of all your right decisions.
[119:63] I keep company with all your worshippers, and those who have your orders in their memory.
[119:64] The earth, O Lord, is full of your mercy: give me knowledge of your rules.
[119:65] &lt;TETH&gt; You have done good to your servant, O Lord, in keeping with your word.
[119:66] Give me knowledge and good sense; for I have put my faith in your teachings.
[119:67] Before I was in trouble I went out of the way; but now I keep your word.
[119:68] You are good, and your works are good; give me knowledge of your rules.
[119:69] The men of pride have said false things about me; but I will keep your orders in my heart.
[119:70] Their hearts are shut up with fat; but my delight is in your law.
[119:71] It is good for me to have been through trouble; so that I might come to the knowledge of your rules.
[119:72] The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver.
[119:73] &lt;JOD&gt; Your hands have made me, and given me form: give me wisdom, so that I may have knowledge of your teaching.
[119:74] Your worshippers will see me and be glad; because my hope has been in your word.
[119:75] I have seen, O Lord, that your decisions are right, and that in unchanging faith you have sent trouble on me.
[119:76] Let your mercy now be my comfort, as you have said to your servant.
[119:77] Let your gentle mercies come to me, so that I may have life; for your law is my delight.
[119:78] Let the men of pride be shamed; because they have falsely given decision against me; but I will give thought to your orders.
[119:79] Let your worshippers be turned to me, and those who have knowledge of your words.
[119:80] Let all my heart be given to your orders, so that I may not be put to shame.
[119:81] &lt;CAPH&gt; My soul is wasted with desire for your salvation: but I have hope in your word.
[119:82] My eyes are full of weariness with searching for your word, saying, When will you give me comfort?
[119:83] For I have become like a wine-skin black with smoke; but I still keep the memory of your rules.
[119:84] How short is the life of your servant! when will you give your decision against those who are attacking me?
[119:85] The men of pride, who are turned away from your law, have put nets for me.
[119:86] All your teachings are certain; they go after me with evil design; give me your help.
[119:87] They had almost put an end to me on earth; but I did not give up your orders.
[119:88] Give me life in your mercy; so that I may be ruled by the unchanging word of your mouth.
[119:89] &lt;LAMED&gt; For ever, O Lord, your word is fixed in heaven.
[119:90] Your faith is unchanging from generation to generation: you have put the earth in its place, and it is not moved.
[119:91] They are ruled this day by your decisions; for all things are your servants.
[119:92] If your law had not been my delight, my troubles would have put an end to me.
[119:93] I will ever keep your orders in mind; for in them I have life.
[119:94] I am yours, O be my saviour; for my desire has been for your rules.
[119:95] The sinners have been waiting for me to give me up to destruction; but I will give all my mind to your unchanging ward.
[119:96] I have seen that nothing on earth is complete; but your teaching is very wide.
[119:97] &lt;MEM&gt; O what love I have for your law! I give thought to it all the day.
[119:98] Your teaching has made me wiser than my haters: for it is mine for ever.
[119:99] I have more knowledge than all my teachers, because I give thought to your unchanging word.
[119:100] I have more wisdom than the old, because I have kept your orders.
[119:101] I have kept back my feet from all evil ways, so that I might be true to your word.
[119:102] My heart has not been turned away from your decisions; for you have been my teacher.
[119:103] How sweet are your sayings to my taste! truly, they are sweeter than honey in my mouth!
[119:104] Through your orders I get wisdom; for this reason I am a hater of every false way.
[119:105] &lt;NUN&gt; Your word is a light for my feet, ever shining on my way.
[119:106] I have made an oath and kept it, to be guided by your upright decisions.
[119:107] I am greatly troubled, O Lord, give me life in keeping with your word.
[119:108] Take, O Lord, the free offerings of my mouth, and give me knowledge of your decisions.
[119:109] My soul is ever in danger; but I still keep the memory of your law.
[119:110] Sinners have put a net to take me; but I was true to your orders.
[119:111] I have taken your unchanging word as an eternal heritage; for it is the joy of my heart.
[119:112] My heart is ever ready to keep your rules, even to the end.
[119:113] &lt;SAMECH&gt; I am a hater of men of doubting mind; but I am a lover of your law.
[119:114] You are my secret place and my breastplate against danger; my hope is in your word.
[119:115] Go far from me, you evil-doers; so that I may keep the teachings of my God.
[119:116] Be my support as you have said, and give me life; let not my hope be turned to shame.
[119:117] Let me not be moved, and I will be safe, and ever take delight in your rules.
[119:118] You have overcome all those who are wandering from your rules; for all their thoughts are false.
[119:119] All the sinners of the earth are like waste metal in your eyes; and for this cause I give my love to your unchanging word.
[119:120] My flesh is moved for fear of you; I give honour to your decisions.
[119:121] &lt;AIN&gt; I have done what is good and right: you will not give me into the hands of those who are working against me.
[119:122] Take your servant's interests into your keeping; let me not be crushed by the men of pride.
[119:123] My eyes are wasted with desire for your salvation, and for the word of your righteousness.
[119:124] Be good to your servant in your mercy, and give me teaching in your rules.
[119:125] I am your servant; give me wisdom, so that I may have knowledge of your unchanging word.
[119:126] It is time, O Lord, for you to let your work be seen; for they have made your law without effect.
[119:127] For this reason I have greater love far your teachings than for gold, even for shining gold.
[119:128] Because of it I keep straight in all things by your orders; and I am a hater of every false way.
[119:129] &lt;PE&gt; Your unchanging word is full of wonder; for this reason my soul keeps it.
[119:130] The opening of your words gives light; it gives good sense to the simple.
[119:131] My mouth was open wide, waiting with great desire for your teachings.
[119:132] Let your eyes be turned to me, and have mercy on me, as it is right for you to do to those who are lovers of your name.
[119:133] Let my steps be guided by your word; and let not sin have control over me.
[119:134] Make me free from the cruel rule of man; then I will keep your orders.
[119:135] Let your servant see the shining of your face; give me knowledge of your rules.
[119:136] Rivers of water are flowing from my eyes, because men do not keep your law.
[119:137] &lt;TZADE&gt; O Lord, great is your righteousness, and upright are your decisions.
[119:138] You have given your unchanging word in righteousness, and it is for ever.
[119:139] My passion has overcome me; because my haters are turned away from your words.
[119:140] Your word is of tested value; and it is dear to your servant.
[119:141] I am small and of no account; but I keep your orders in mind.
[119:142] Your righteousness is an unchanging righteousness, and your law is certain.
[119:143] Pain and trouble have overcome me: but your teachings are my delight.
[119:144] The righteousness of your unchanging word is eternal; give me wisdom so that I may have life.
[119:145] &lt;KOPH&gt; I have made my prayer with all my heart; give answer to me, O Lord: I will keep your rules.
[119:146] My cry has gone up to you; take me out of trouble, and I will be guided by your unchanging word.
[119:147] Before the sun is up, my cry for help comes to your ear; my hope is in your words.
[119:148] In the night watches I am awake, so that I may give thought to your saying.
[119:149] Let my voice come to you, in your mercy; O Lord, by your decisions give me life.
[119:150] Those who have evil designs against me come near; they are far from your law.
[119:151] You are near, O Lord; and all your teachings are true.
[119:152] I have long had knowledge that your unchanging word is for ever.
[119:153] &lt;RESH&gt; O see my trouble, and be my saviour; for I keep your law in my mind,
[119:154] Undertake my cause, and come to my help, give me life, as you have said.
[119:155] Salvation is far from evil-doers; for they have made no search for your rules.
[119:156] Great is the number of your mercies, O Lord; give me life in keeping with your decisions.
[119:157] Great is the number of those who are against me; but I have not been turned away from your unchanging word.
[119:158] I saw with hate those who were untrue to you; for they did not keep your saying.
[119:159] See how great is my love for your orders: give me life, O Lord, in keeping with your mercy.
[119:160] Your word is true from the first; and your upright decision is unchanging for ever.
[119:161] &lt;SHIN&gt; Rulers have been cruel to me without cause; but I have the fear of your word in my heart.
[119:162] I am delighted by your saying, like a man who makes discovery of great wealth.
[119:163] I am full of hate and disgust for false words; but I am a lover of your law.
[119:164] Seven times a day do I give you praise, because of your upright decisions.
[119:165] Great peace have lovers of your law; they have no cause for falling.
[119:166] Lord, my hope has been in your salvation; and I have kept your teachings.
[119:167] My soul has kept your unchanging word; great is my love for it.
[119:168] I have been ruled by your orders; for all my ways are before you.
[119:169] &lt;TAU&gt; Let my cry come before you, O Lord; give me wisdom in keeping with your word.
[119:170] Let my prayer come before you; take me out of trouble, as you have said.
[119:171] Let my lips be flowing with praise, because you have given me knowledge of your rules.
[119:172] Let my tongue make songs in praise of your word; for all your teachings are righteousness.
[119:173] Let your hand be near for my help; for I have given my heart to your orders.
[119:174] All my desire has been for your salvation, O Lord; and your law is my delight.
[119:175] Give life to my soul so that it may give you praise; and let your decisions be my support.
[119:176] I have gone out of the way like a wandering sheep; make search for your servant; for I keep your teachings ever in mind.

[89:1] &lt;Maschil. Of Ethan the Ezrahite.&gt; My song will be of the mercies of the Lord for ever: with my mouth will I make his faith clear to all generations.
[89:2] For you have said, Mercy will be made strong for ever; my faith will be unchanging in the heavens.
[89:3] I have made an agreement with the man of my selection, I have made an oath to David my servant;
[89:4] I will make your seed go on for ever, your kingdom will be strong through all generations. (Selah.)
[89:5] In heaven let them give praise for your wonders, O Lord; and your unchanging faith among the saints.
[89:6] For who is there in the heavens in comparison with the Lord? who is like the Lord among the sons of the gods?
[89:7] God is greatly to be feared among the saints, and to be honoured over all those who are about him.
[89:8] O Lord God of armies, who is strong like you, O Jah? and your unchanging faith is round about you.
[89:9] You have rule over the sea in storm; when its waves are troubled, you make them calm.
[89:10] Rahab was crushed by you like one wounded to death; with your strong arm you put to flight all your haters.
[89:11] Yours are the heavens, and the earth is yours; you have made the world, and everything which is in it.
[89:12] You have made the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon are sounding with joy at your name.
[89:13] Yours is an arm of power; strong is your hand and high your right hand.
[89:14] The seat of your kingdom is resting on righteousness and right judging: mercy and good faith come before your face.
[89:15] Happy are the people who have knowledge of the holy cry: the light of your face, O Lord, will be shining on their way.
[89:16] In your name will they have joy all the day: in your righteousness will they be lifted up.
[89:17] For you are the glory of their strength; in your pleasure will our horn be lifted up.
[89:18] For our breastplate is the Lord; and our king is the Holy One of Israel's.
[89:19] Then your voice came to your holy one in a vision, saying, I have put the crown on a strong one, lifting up one taken from among the people.
[89:20] I have made discovery of David my servant; I have put my holy oil on his head.
[89:21] My hand will be his support; my arm will give him strength.
[89:22] The deceit of those who are against him will not overcome him; he will not be troubled by the sons of evil.
[89:23] I will have those who are against him broken before his face, and his haters will be crushed under my blows.
[89:24] But my faith and my mercy will be with him; and in my name will his horn be lifted up.
[89:25] I will put his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
[89:26] He will say to me, You are my father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.
[89:27] And I will make him the first of my sons, most high over the kings of the earth.
[89:28] I will keep my mercy for him for ever; my agreement with him will not be changed.
[89:29] His seed will keep their place for ever; his kingdom will be eternal, like the heavens.
[89:30] If his children give up my law, and are not ruled by my decisions;
[89:31] If my rules are broken, and my orders are not kept;
[89:32] Then I will send punishment on them for their sin; my rod will be the reward of their evil-doing.
[89:33] But I will not take away my mercy from him, and will not be false to my faith.
[89:34] I will be true to my agreement; the things which have gone out of my lips will not be changed.
[89:35] I have made an oath once by my holy name, that I will not be false to David.
[89:36] His seed will not come to an end for ever; the seat of his kingdom will be like the sun before me.
[89:37] It will be fixed for ever like the moon; and the witness in heaven is true. (Selah.)
[89:38] But you have put him away in disgust; you have been angry with the king of your selection.
[89:39] You have made your agreement with your servant of no effect: you have had no respect for his crown, it has come down even to the earth.
[89:40] All his walls are broken down; you have given his strong towers to destruction.
[89:41] All those who come by take away his goods; he is laughed at by his neighbours.
[89:42] You have given power to the right hand of his haters; you have made glad all those who are against him.
[89:43] His sword is turned back; you have not been his support in the fight.
[89:44] You have put an end to his glory: the seat of his kingdom has been levelled to the earth.
[89:45] You have made him old before his time; he is covered with shame. (Selah.)
[89:46] How long, O Lord, will you Keep yourself for ever from our eyes? how long will your wrath be burning like fire?
[89:47] See how short my time is; why have you made all men for no purpose?
[89:48] What man now living will not see death? will he be able to keep back his soul from the underworld? (Selah.)
[89:49] Lord, where are your earlier mercies? where is the oath which you made to David in unchanging faith?
[89:50] Keep in mind, O Lord, the shame of your servants, and how the bitter words of all the people have come into my heart;
[89:51] The bitter words of your haters, O Lord, shaming the footsteps of your king.
[89:52] Let the Lord be praised for ever. So be it, So be it.

[71:1] In you, O Lord, have I put my hope; let me never be shamed.
[71:2] Keep me safe in your righteousness, and come to my help; give ear to my voice, and be my saviour.
[71:3] Be my strong Rock, the strong place of my salvation; for you are my Rock, and my safe place.
[71:4] O my God, take me out of the hand of the sinner, out of the hand of the evil and cruel man.
[71:5] For you are my hope, O Lord God; I have had faith in you from the time when I was young.
[71:6] You have been my support from the day of my birth; you took me out of my mother's body; my praise will be ever of you.
[71:7] I am a wonder to all; but you are my strong tower.
[71:8] My mouth will be full of your praise and glory all the day.
[71:9] Do not give me up when I am old; be my help even when my strength is gone.
[71:10] For my haters are waiting secretly for me; and those who are watching for my soul are banded together in their evil designs,
[71:11] Saying, God has given him up; go after him and take him, for he has no helper.
[71:12] O God, be not far from me; O my God, come quickly to my help.
[71:13] Let those who say evil against my soul be overcome and put to shame; let my haters be made low and have no honour.
[71:14] But I will go on ever hoping, and increasing in all your praise.
[71:15] My mouth will make clear your righteousness and your salvation all the day; for they are more than may be measured.
[71:16] I will give news of the great acts of the Lord God; my words will be of your righteousness, and of yours only.
[71:17] O God, you have been my teacher from the time when I was young; and I have been talking of your works of wonder even till now.
[71:18] Now when I am old and grey-headed, O God, give me not up; till I have made clear your strength to this generation, and your power to all those to come.
[71:19] Your righteousness, O God, is very high; you have done great things; O God, who is like you?
[71:20] You, who have sent great and bitter troubles on me, will give me life again, lifting me up from the deep waters of the underworld.
[71:21] You will make me greater than before, and give me comfort on every side.
[71:22] I will give praise to you with instruments of music, O my God, for you are true; I will make songs to you with music, O Holy One of Israel.
[71:23] Joy will be on my lips when I make melody to you; and in my soul, to which you have given salvation.
[71:24] My tongue will be talking of your righteousness all the day; for those whose purpose is to do me evil have been crushed and put to shame.

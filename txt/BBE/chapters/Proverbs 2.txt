[2:1] My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind;
[2:2] So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge;
[2:3] Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge;
[2:4] If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth;
[2:5] Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours.
[2:6] For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason:
[2:7] He has salvation stored up for the upright, he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil;
[2:8] He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him.
[2:9] Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way.
[2:10] For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul;
[2:11] Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you;
[2:12] Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false;
[2:13] Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads;
[2:14] Who take pleasure in wrongdoing, and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner;
[2:15] Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil:
[2:16] To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue;
[2:17] Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind:
[2:18] For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades:
[2:19] Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life:
[2:20] So that you may go in the way of good men, and keep in the footsteps of the upright.
[2:21] For the upright will be living in the land, and the good will have it for their heritage.
[2:22] But sinners will be cut off from the land, and those whose acts are false will be uprooted.

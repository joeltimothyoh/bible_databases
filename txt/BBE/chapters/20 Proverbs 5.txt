[5:1] My son, give attention to my wisdom; let your ear be turned to my teaching:
[5:2] So that you may be ruled by a wise purpose, and your lips may keep knowledge.
[5:3] For honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman, and her mouth is smoother than oil;
[5:4] But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword;
[5:5] Her feet go down to death, and her steps to the underworld;
[5:6] She never keeps her mind on the road of life; her ways are uncertain, she has no knowledge.
[5:7] Give ear to me then, my sons, and do not put away my words from you.
[5:8] Go far away from her, do not come near the door of her house;
[5:9] For fear that you may give your honour to others, and your wealth to strange men:
[5:10] And strange men may be full of your wealth, and the fruit of your work go to the house of others;
[5:11] And you will be full of grief at the end of your life, when your flesh and your body are wasted;
[5:12] And you will say, How was teaching hated by me, and my heart put no value on training;
[5:13] I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers, my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me!
[5:14] I was in almost all evil in the company of the people.
[5:15] Let water from your store and not that of others be your drink, and running water from your fountain.
[5:16] Let not your springs be flowing in the streets, or your streams of water in the open places.
[5:17] Let them be for yourself only, not for other men with you.
[5:18] Let blessing be on your fountain; have joy in the wife of your early years.
[5:19] As a loving hind and a gentle doe, let her breasts ever give you rapture; let your passion at all times be moved by her love.
[5:20] Why let yourself, my son, go out of the way with a strange woman, and take another woman in your arms?
[5:21] For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he puts all his goings in the scales.
[5:22] The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin.
[5:23] He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way.

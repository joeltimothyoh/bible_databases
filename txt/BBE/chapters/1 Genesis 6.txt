[6:1] And after a time, when men were increasing on the earth, and had daughters,
[6:2] The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them.
[6:3] And the Lord said, My spirit will not be in man for ever, for he is only flesh; so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years.
[6:4] There were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days; and after that, when the sons of God had connection with the daughters of men, they gave birth to children: these were the great men of old days, the men of great name.
[6:5] And the Lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth, and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil.
[6:6] And the Lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth, and grief was in his heart.
[6:7] And the Lord said, I will take away man, whom I have made, from the face of the earth, even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air; for I have sorrow for having made them.
[6:8] But Noah had grace in the eyes of God.
[6:9] These are the generations of Noah. Noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation: he went in the ways of God.
[6:10] And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[6:11] And the earth was evil in God's eyes and full of violent ways.
[6:12] And God, looking on the earth, saw that it was evil: for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth.
[6:13] And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth.
[6:14] Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out.
[6:15] And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
[6:16] You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors.
[6:17] For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end.
[6:18] But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
[6:19] And you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing, and keep them safe with you; they will be male and female.
[6:20] Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction.
[6:21] And make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them.
[6:22] And all these things Noah did; as God said, so he did.

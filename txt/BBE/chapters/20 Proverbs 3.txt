[3:1] My son, keep my teaching in your memory, and my rules in your heart:
[3:2] For they will give you increase of days, years of life, and peace.
[3:3] Let not mercy and good faith go from you; let them be hanging round your neck, recorded on your heart;
[3:4] So you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of God and men.
[3:5] Put all your hope in God, not looking to your reason for support.
[3:6] In all your ways give ear to him, and he will make straight your footsteps.
[3:7] Put no high value on your wisdom: let the fear of the Lord be before you, and keep yourself from evil:
[3:8] This will give strength to your flesh, and new life to your bones.
[3:9] Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase:
[3:10] So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine.
[3:11] My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training:
[3:12] For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain.
[3:13] Happy is the man who makes discovery of wisdom, and he who gets knowledge.
[3:14] For trading in it is better than trading in silver, and its profit greater than bright gold.
[3:15] She is of more value than jewels, and nothing for which you may have a desire is fair in comparison with her.
[3:16] Long life is in her right hand, and in her left are wealth and honour.
[3:17] Her ways are ways of delight, and all her goings are peace.
[3:18] She is a tree of life to all who take her in their hands, and happy is everyone who keeps her.
[3:19] The Lord by wisdom put in position the bases of the earth; by reason he put the heavens in their place.
[3:20] By his knowledge the deep was parted, and dew came dropping from the skies.
[3:21] My son, keep good sense, and do not let wise purpose go from your eyes.
[3:22] So they will be life for your soul, and grace for your neck.
[3:23] Then you will go safely on your way, and your feet will have no cause for slipping.
[3:24] When you take your rest you will have no fear, and on your bed sleep will be sweet to you.
[3:25] Have no fear of sudden danger, or of the storm which will come on evil-doers:
[3:26] For the Lord will be your hope, and will keep your foot from being taken in the net.
[3:27] Do not keep back good from those who have a right to it, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
[3:28] Say not to your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you at the time.
[3:29] Do not make evil designs against your neighbour, when he is living with you without fear.
[3:30] Do not take up a cause at law against a man for nothing, if he has done you no wrong.
[3:31] Have no envy of the violent man, or take any of his ways as an example.
[3:32] For the wrong-hearted man is hated by the Lord, but he is a friend to the upright.
[3:33] The curse of the Lord is on the house of the evil-doer, but his blessing is on the tent of the upright.
[3:34] He makes sport of the men of pride, but he gives grace to the gentle-hearted.
[3:35] The wise will have glory for their heritage, but shame will be the reward of the foolish.

[20:1] And God said all these words:
[20:2] I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house.
[20:3] You are to have no other gods but me.
[20:4] You are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth:
[20:5] You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation of my haters;
[20:6] And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.
[20:7] You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord
[20:8] Keep in memory the Sabbath and let it be a holy day.
[20:9] On six days do all your work:
[20:10] But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man-servant or your woman-servant, your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you:
[20:11] For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy.
[20:12] Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
[20:13] Do not put anyone to death without cause.
[20:14] Do not be false to the married relation.
[20:15] Do not take the property of another.
[20:16] Do not give false witness against your neighbour.
[20:17] Let not your desire be turned to your neighbour's house, or his wife or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his.
[20:18] And all the people were watching the thunderings and the flames and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when they saw it, they kept far off, shaking with fear.
[20:19] And they said to Moses, To your words we will give ear, but let not the voice of God come to our ears, for fear death may come on us.
[20:20] And Moses said to the people, Have no fear: for God has come to put you to the test, so that fearing him you may be kept from sin.
[20:21] And the people kept their places far off, but Moses went near to the dark cloud where God was.
[20:22] And the Lord said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You yourselves have seen that my voice has come to you from heaven
[20:23] Gods of silver and gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves.
[20:24] Make for me an altar of earth, offering on it your burned offerings and your peace-offerings, your sheep and your oxen: in every place where I have put the memory of my name, I will come to you and give you my blessing.
[20:25] And if you make me an altar of stone do not make it of cut stones: for the touch of an instrument will make it unclean.
[20:26] And do not go up by steps to my altar, for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered.

[2:1] Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
[2:2] as newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,
[2:3] if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
[2:4] coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.
[2:5] You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[2:6] Because it is contained in Scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious: He who believes in him will not be disappointed."
[2:7] For you therefore who believe is the honor, but for such as are disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected, Has become the chief cornerstone,"
[2:8] and, "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.
[2:9] But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:
[2:10] who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
[2:11] Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
[2:12] having good behavior among the nations, so in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.
[2:13] Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
[2:14] or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.
[2:15] For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
[2:16] as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
[2:17] Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
[2:18] Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.
[2:19] For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.
[2:20] For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.
[2:21] For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you{TR reads "us" instead of "you"} an example, that you should follow his steps,
[2:22] who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."
[2:23] Who, when he was cursed, didn't curse back. When he suffered, didn't threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;
[2:24] who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
[2:25] For you were going astray like sheep; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer{"Overseer" is from the Greek episkopon, which can mean overseer, curator, guardian, or superintendent.} of your souls.

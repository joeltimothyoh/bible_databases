[3:1] For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support, The whole supply of bread, And the whole supply of water;
[3:2] The mighty man, The man of war, The judge, The prophet, The diviner, The elder,
[3:3] The captain of fifty, The honorable man, The counselor, The skilled craftsman, And the clever enchanter.
[3:4] I will give boys to be their princes, And children shall rule over them.
[3:5] The people will be oppressed, Everyone by another, And everyone by his neighbor. The child will behave himself proudly against the old man, And the base against the honorable.
[3:6] Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, "You have clothing, you be our ruler, And let this ruin be under your hand."
[3:7] In that day he will cry out, saying, I will not be a healer; For in my house is neither bread nor clothing. You shall not make me ruler of the people.
[3:8] For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; Because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, To provoke the eyes of his glory.
[3:9] The look of their faces testify against them. They parade their sin like Sodom. They don't hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
[3:10] Tell the righteous "Good!" For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
[3:11] Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them; For the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.
[3:12] As for my people, children are their oppressors, And women rule over them. My people, those who lead you cause you to err, And destroy the way of your paths.
[3:13] Yahweh stands up to contend, And stands to judge the peoples.
[3:14] Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, And their leaders: "It is you who have eaten up the vineyard. The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
[3:15] What do you mean that you crush my people, And grind the face of the poor?" says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.
[3:16] Moreover Yahweh said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, And walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes, Walking to trip as they go, Jingling ornaments on their feet;
[3:17] Therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion, And Yahweh will make their scalps bald."
[3:18] In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
[3:19] the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
[3:20] the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,
[3:21] the signet rings, the nose rings,
[3:22] the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
[3:23] the hand-mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.
[3:24] It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well set hair, baldness; Instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; And branding instead of beauty.
[3:25] Your men shall fall by the sword, And your mighty in the war.
[3:26] Her gates shall lament and mourn; And she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.

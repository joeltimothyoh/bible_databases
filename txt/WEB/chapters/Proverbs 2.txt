[2:1] My son, if you will receive my words, And store up my commandments within you;
[2:2] So as to turn your ear to wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding;
[2:3] Yes, if you call out for discernment, And lift up your voice for understanding;
[2:4] If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures:
[2:5] Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, And find the knowledge of God.
[2:6] For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
[2:7] He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;
[2:8] That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.
[2:9] Then you will understand righteousness and justice, Equity and every good path.
[2:10] For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
[2:11] Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you,
[2:12] To deliver you from the way of evil, From the men who speak perverse things;
[2:13] Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;
[2:14] Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;
[2:15] Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:
[2:16] To deliver you from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
[2:17] Who forsakes the friend of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God:
[2:18] For her house leads down to death, Her paths to the dead.
[2:19] None who go to her return again, Neither do they attain to the paths of life:
[2:20] That you may walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.
[2:21] For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it.
[2:22] But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.

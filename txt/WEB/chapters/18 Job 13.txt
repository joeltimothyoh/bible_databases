[13:1] "Behold, my eye has seen all this, My ear has heard and understood it.
[13:2] What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you.
[13:3] "Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God.
[13:4] But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value.
[13:5] Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise.
[13:6] Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
[13:7] Will you speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?
[13:8] Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God?
[13:9] Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?
[13:10] He will surely reprove you If you secretly show partiality.
[13:11] Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you?
[13:12] Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.
[13:13] "Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will.
[13:14] Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?
[13:15] Behold, he will kill me; I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.
[13:16] This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.
[13:17] Hear diligently my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears.
[13:18] See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous.
[13:19] Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.
[13:20] "Only don't do two things to me; Then I will not hide myself from your face:
[13:21] Withdraw your hand far from me; And don't let your terror make me afraid.
[13:22] Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and you answer me.
[13:23] How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin.
[13:24] Why hide you your face, And hold me for your enemy?
[13:25] Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble?
[13:26] For you write bitter things against me, And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:
[13:27] You also put my feet in the stocks, And mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet:
[13:28] Though I am decaying like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.

[24:1] When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
[24:2] Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.
[24:3] He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, The man whose eye was closed says;
[24:4] He says, who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:
[24:5] How goodly are your tents, Jacob, Your tents, Israel!
[24:6] As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Yahweh has planted, As cedar trees beside the waters.
[24:7] Water shall flow from his buckets, His seed shall be in many waters, His king shall be higher than Agag, His kingdom shall be exalted.
[24:8] God brings him forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, Shall break their bones in pieces, Smite [them] through with his arrows.
[24:9] He couched, he lay down as a lion, As a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be everyone who blesses you, Cursed be everyone who curses you.
[24:10] Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
[24:11] Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.
[24:12] Balaam said to Balak, Didn't I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,
[24:13] If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that will I speak?
[24:14] Now, behold, I go to my people: come, [and] I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.
[24:15] He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, The man whose eye was closed says;
[24:16] He says, who hears the words of God, Knows the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:
[24:17] I see him, but not now; I see him, but not near: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, A scepter shall rise out of Israel, Shall strike through the corners of Moab, Break down all the sons of tumult.
[24:18] Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, [who were] his enemies; While Israel does valiantly.
[24:19] Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, Shall destroy the remnant from the city.
[24:20] He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction.
[24:21] He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling-place, Your nest is set in the rock.
[24:22] Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry you away captive.
[24:23] He took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this?
[24:24] But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim, They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber; He also shall come to destruction.
[24:25] Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.

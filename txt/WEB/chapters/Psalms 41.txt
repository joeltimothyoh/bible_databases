[41:1] &gt; Blessed is he who considers the poor: Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.
[41:2] Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive, He shall be blessed on the earth, And he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.
[41:3] Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, And restore him from his bed of illness.
[41:4] I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you."
[41:5] My enemies speak evil against me: "When will he die, and his name perish?"
[41:6] If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.
[41:7] All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me.
[41:8] "An evil disease," they say, "has afflicted him. Now that he lies he shall rise up no more."
[41:9] Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who ate bread with me, Has lifted up his heel against me.
[41:10] But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, That I may repay them.
[41:11] By this I know that you delight in me, Because my enemy doesn't triumph over me.
[41:12] As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, And set me in your presence forever.
[41:13] Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.

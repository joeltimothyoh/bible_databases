[7:1] &gt; Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
[7:2] Lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, Ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
[7:3] Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,
[7:4] If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (Yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
[7:5] Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
[7:6] Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.
[7:7] Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.
[7:8] Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, And to my integrity that is in me.
[7:9] Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, But establish the righteous; Their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.
[7:10] My shield is with God, Who saves the upright in heart.
[7:11] God is a righteous judge, Yes, a God who has indignation every day.
[7:12] If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; He has bent and strung his bow.
[7:13] He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.
[7:14] Behold, he travails with iniquity; Yes, he has conceived mischief, And brought forth falsehood.
[7:15] He has dug a hole, And has fallen into the pit which he made.
[7:16] The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.
[7:17] I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.

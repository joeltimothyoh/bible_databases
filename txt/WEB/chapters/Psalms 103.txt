[103:1] &gt; Praise Yahweh, my soul! All that is within me, praise his holy name!
[103:2] Praise Yahweh, my soul, And don't forget all his benefits;
[103:3] Who forgives all your sins; Who heals all your diseases;
[103:4] Who redeems your life from destruction; Who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies;
[103:5] Who satisfies your desire with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
[103:6] Yahweh executes righteous acts, And justice for all who are oppressed.
[103:7] He made known his ways to Moses, His deeds to the children of Israel.
[103:8] Yahweh is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.
[103:9] He will not always accuse; Neither will he stay angry forever.
[103:10] He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor repaid us for our iniquities.
[103:11] For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him.
[103:12] As far as the east is from the west, So far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[103:13] Like a father has compassion on his children, So Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.
[103:14] For he knows how we are made. He remembers that we are dust.
[103:15] As for man, his days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
[103:16] For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.
[103:17] But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, His righteousness to children's children;
[103:18] To those who keep his covenant, To those who remember to obey his precepts.
[103:19] Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens. His kingdom rules over all.
[103:20] Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, Who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, Obeying the voice of his word.
[103:21] Praise Yahweh, all you hosts of his, You servants of his, who do his pleasure.
[103:22] Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, In all places of his dominion. Praise Yahweh, my soul.

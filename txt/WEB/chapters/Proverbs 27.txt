[27:1] Don't boast about tomorrow; For you don't know what a day may bring forth.
[27:2] Let another man praise you, And not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips.
[27:3] A stone is heavy, And sand is a burden; But a fool's provocation is heavier than both.
[27:4] Wrath is cruel, And anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy?
[27:5] Better is open rebuke Than hidden love.
[27:6] Faithful are the wounds of a friend; Although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
[27:7] A full soul loathes a honeycomb; But to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.
[27:8] As a bird that wanders from her nest, So is a man who wanders from his home.
[27:9] Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; So does earnest counsel from a man's friend.
[27:10] Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend. Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster: Better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.
[27:11] Be wise, my son, And bring joy to my heart, Then I can answer my tormentor.
[27:12] A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it:
[27:13] Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger; Hold it for a wayward woman!
[27:14] He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, It will be taken as a curse by him.
[27:15] A continual dropping on a rainy day And a contentious wife are alike:
[27:16] Restraining her is like restraining the wind, Or like grasping oil in his right hand.
[27:17] Iron sharpens iron; So a man sharpens his friend's countenance.
[27:18] Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored.
[27:19] As water reflects a face, So a man's heart reflects the man.
[27:20] Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And a man's eyes are never satisfied.
[27:21] The crucible is for silver, And the furnace for gold; But man is refined by his praise.
[27:22] Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, Yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
[27:23] Know well the state of your flocks, And pay attention to your herds:
[27:24] For riches are not forever, Nor does even the crown endure to all generations.
[27:25] The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, The grasses of the hills are gathered in.
[27:26] The lambs are for your clothing, And the goats are the price of a field.
[27:27] There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, For your family's food, And for the nourishment of your servant girls.

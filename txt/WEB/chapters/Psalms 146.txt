[146:1] Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul.
[146:2] While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
[146:3] Don't put your trust in princes, Each a son of man in whom there is no help.
[146:4] His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.
[146:5] Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Yahweh, his God:
[146:6] Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is in them; Who keeps truth forever;
[146:7] Who executes justice for the oppressed; Who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners.
[146:8] Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind. Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down. Yahweh loves the righteous.
[146:9] Yahweh preserves the foreigners. He upholds the fatherless and widow, But the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
[146:10] Yahweh will reign forever; Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!

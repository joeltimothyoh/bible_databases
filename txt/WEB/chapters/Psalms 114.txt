[114:1] When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of foreign language;
[114:2] Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
[114:3] The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.
[114:4] The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.
[114:5] What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan, that you turned back?
[114:6] You mountains, that you skipped like rams; You little hills, like lambs?
[114:7] Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,
[114:8] Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a spring of waters.

[52:1] &gt; Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? God's loving kindness endures continually.
[52:2] Your tongue plots destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
[52:3] You love evil more than good, Lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.
[52:4] You love all devouring words, You deceitful tongue.
[52:5] God will likewise destroy you forever. He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, And root you out of the land of the living. Selah.
[52:6] The righteous also will see it, and fear, And laugh at him, saying,
[52:7] "Behold, this is the man who didn't make God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness."
[52:8] But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house. I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever.
[52:9] I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, In the presence of your saints.

[57:1] &gt; Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, For my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, Until disaster has passed.
[57:2] I cry out to God Most High, To God who accomplishes my requests for me.
[57:3] He will send from heaven, and save me, He rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out his loving kindness and his truth.
[57:4] My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
[57:5] Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be above all the earth!
[57:6] They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into the midst of it themselves. Selah.
[57:7] My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
[57:8] Wake up, my glory! Wake up, psaltery and harp! I will wake up the dawn.
[57:9] I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations.
[57:10] For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, And your truth to the skies.
[57:11] Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.

[1:1] Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the way of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
[1:2] But his delight is in Yahweh's law; On his law he meditates day and night.
[1:3] He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.
[1:4] The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
[1:5] Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
[1:6] For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked shall perish.

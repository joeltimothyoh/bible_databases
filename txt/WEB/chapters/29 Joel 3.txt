[3:1] "For, behold, in those days, And in that time, When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
[3:2] I will gather all nations, And will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; And I will execute judgment on them there for my people, And for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. They have divided my land,
[3:3] And have cast lots for my people, And have given a boy for a prostitute, And sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
[3:4] "Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon, And all the regions of Philistia? Will you repay me? And if you repay me, I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.
[3:5] Because you have taken my silver and my gold, And have carried my finest treasures into your temples,
[3:6] And have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, That you may remove them far from their border.
[3:7] Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them, And will return your repayment on your own head;
[3:8] And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, And they will sell them to the men of Sheba, To a faraway nation, For Yahweh has spoken it."
[3:9] Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war. Stir up the mighty men. Let all the warriors draw near. Let them come up.
[3:10] Beat your plowshares into swords, And your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, "I am strong."
[3:11] Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves together." Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.
[3:12] "Let the nations arouse themselves, And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; For there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
[3:13] Put in the sickle; For the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the winepress is full, The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great."
[3:14] Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.
[3:15] The sun and the moon are darkened, And the stars withdraw their shining."
[3:16] Yahweh will roar from Zion, And thunder from Jerusalem; And the heavens and the earth will shake; But Yahweh will be a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to the children of Israel.
[3:17] "So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God, Dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy, And no strangers will pass through her any more.
[3:18] It will happen in that day, That the mountains will drop down sweet wine, The hills will flow with milk, All the brooks of Judah will flow with waters; And a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh, And will water the valley of Shittim.
[3:19] Egypt will be a desolation, And Edom will be a desolate wilderness, For the violence done to the children of Judah, Because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
[3:20] But Judah will be inhabited forever, And Jerusalem from generation to generation.
[3:21] I will cleanse their blood, That I have not cleansed: For Yahweh dwells in Zion."

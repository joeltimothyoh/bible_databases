[8:1] &gt; Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, Who has set your glory above the heavens!
[8:2] From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, Because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.
[8:3] When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, The moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
[8:4] What is man, that you think of him? The son of man, that you care for him?
[8:5] For you have made him a little lower than God,{Hebrew: Elohim} And crowned him with glory and honor.
[8:6] You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:
[8:7] All sheep and oxen, Yes, and the animals of the field,
[8:8] The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, And whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
[8:9] Yahweh, our Lord, How majestic is your name in all the earth!

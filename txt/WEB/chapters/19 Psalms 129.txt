[129:1] &gt; Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say,
[129:2] Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, Yet they have not prevailed against me.
[129:3] The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long.
[129:4] Yahweh is righteous. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
[129:5] Let them be disappointed and turned backward, All those who hate Zion.
[129:6] Let them be as the grass on the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;
[129:7] With which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, Nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
[129:8] Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh."

[123:1] &gt; To you I do lift up my eyes, You who sit in the heavens.
[123:2] Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; So our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, Until he has mercy on us.
[123:3] Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, For we have endured much contempt.
[123:4] Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, With the contempt of the proud.

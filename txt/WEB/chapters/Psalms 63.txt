[63:1] &gt; God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you, My flesh longs for you, In a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
[63:2] So I have seen you in the sanctuary, Watching your power and your glory.
[63:3] Because your loving kindness is better than life, My lips shall praise you.
[63:4] So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.
[63:5] My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,
[63:6] When I remember you on my bed, And think about you in the night watches.
[63:7] For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.
[63:8] My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up.
[63:9] But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
[63:10] They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food.
[63:11] But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, For the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.

[3:1] After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.
[3:2] Job answered:
[3:3] "Let the day perish in which I was born, The night which said, 'There is a man-child conceived.'
[3:4] Let that day be darkness; Don't let God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine on it.
[3:5] Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the day terrify it.
[3:6] As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.
[3:7] Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.
[3:8] Let them curse it who curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
[3:9] Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, Neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
[3:10] Because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb, Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
[3:11] "Why didn't I die from the womb? Why didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
[3:12] Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?
[3:13] For now should I have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,
[3:14] With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;
[3:15] Or with princes who had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:
[3:16] Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants who never saw light.
[3:17] There the wicked cease from troubling; There the weary are at rest.
[3:18] There the prisoners are at ease together. They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster.
[3:19] The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master.
[3:20] "Why is light given to him who is in misery, Life to the bitter in soul,
[3:21] Who long for death, but it doesn't come; Dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
[3:22] Who rejoice exceedingly, Are glad, when they can find the grave?
[3:23] Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, Whom God has hedged in?
[3:24] For my sighing comes before I eat, My groanings are poured out like water.
[3:25] For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid of comes to me.
[3:26] I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble comes."

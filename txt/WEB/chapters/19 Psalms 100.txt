[100:1] &gt; Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands!
[100:2] Serve Yahweh with gladness. Come before his presence with singing.
[100:3] Know that Yahweh, he is God. It is he who has made us, and we are his. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
[100:4] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, Into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
[100:5] For Yahweh is good. His loving kindness endures forever, His faithfulness to all generations.

[115:1] Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, But to your name give glory, For your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake.
[115:2] Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?"
[115:3] But our God is in the heavens. He does whatever he pleases.
[115:4] Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
[115:5] They have mouths, but they don't speak; They have eyes, but they don't see;
[115:6] They have ears, but they don't hear; They have noses, but they don't smell;
[115:7] They have hands, but they don't feel; They have feet, but they don't walk; Neither do they speak through their throat.
[115:8] Those who make them will be like them; Yes, everyone who trusts in them.
[115:9] Israel, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield.
[115:10] House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield.
[115:11] You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh! He is their help and their shield.
[115:12] Yahweh remembers us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.
[115:13] He will bless those who fear Yahweh, Both small and great.
[115:14] May Yahweh increase you more and more, You and your children.
[115:15] Blessed are you by Yahweh, Who made heaven and earth.
[115:16] The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; But the earth has he given to the children of men.
[115:17] The dead don't praise Yah, Neither any who go down into silence;
[115:18] But we will bless Yah, From this time forth and forevermore. Praise Yah!

[20:1] Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
[20:2] "Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.
[20:3] I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame; The spirit of my understanding answers me.
[20:4] Don't you know this from old time, Since man was placed on earth,
[20:5] That the triumphing of the wicked is short, The joy of the godless but for a moment?
[20:6] Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach to the clouds,
[20:7] Yet he shall perish forever like his own dung, Those who have seen him shall say, 'Where is he?'
[20:8] He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.
[20:9] The eye which saw him shall see him no more, Neither shall his place any more see him.
[20:10] His children shall seek the favor of the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth.
[20:11] His bones are full of his youth, But youth shall lie down with him in the dust.
[20:12] "Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,
[20:13] Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;
[20:14] Yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him.
[20:15] He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.
[20:16] He shall suck cobra venom. The viper's tongue shall kill him.
[20:17] He shall not look at the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.
[20:18] That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.
[20:19] For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
[20:20] "Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save anything of that in which he delights.
[20:21] There was nothing left that he didn't devour, Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
[20:22] In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him: The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.
[20:23] When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating.
[20:24] He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through.
[20:25] He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him.
[20:26] All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
[20:27] The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, The earth shall rise up against him.
[20:28] The increase of his house shall depart; They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.
[20:29] This is the portion of a wicked man from God, The heritage appointed to him by God."

[19:1] &gt; The heavens declare the glory of God. The expanse shows his handiwork.
[19:2] Day after day they pour forth speech, And night after night they display knowledge.
[19:3] There is no speech nor language, Where their voice is not heard.
[19:4] Their voice has gone out through all the earth, Their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,
[19:5] Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, Like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.
[19:6] His going forth is from the end of the heavens, His circuit to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat.
[19:7] Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul. Yahweh's testimony is sure, making wise the simple.
[19:8] Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[19:9] The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.
[19:10] More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
[19:11] Moreover by them is your servant warned. In keeping them there is great reward.
[19:12] Who can discern his errors? Forgive me from hidden errors.
[19:13] Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright, I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
[19:14] Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.

[83:1] &gt; God, don't keep silent. Don't keep silent, And don't be still, God.
[83:2] For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
[83:3] They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.
[83:4] "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them as a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more."
[83:5] For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you.
[83:6] The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
[83:7] Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
[83:8] Assyria also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.
[83:9] Do to them as you did to Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
[83:10] Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.
[83:11] Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
[83:12] Who said, "Let us take possession Of God's pasturelands."
[83:13] My God, make them like tumbleweed; Like chaff before the wind.
[83:14] As the fire that burns the forest, As the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
[83:15] So pursue them with your tempest, And terrify them with your storm.
[83:16] Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek your name, Yahweh.
[83:17] Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish;
[83:18] That they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, Are the Most High over all the earth.

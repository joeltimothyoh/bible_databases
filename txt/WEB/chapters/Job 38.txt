[38:1] Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,
[38:2] "Who is this who darkens counsel By words without knowledge?
[38:3] Brace yourself like a man, For I will question you, then you answer me!
[38:4] "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.
[38:5] Who determined the measures of it, if you know? Or who stretched the line on it?
[38:6] Whereupon were the foundations of it fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,
[38:7] When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
[38:8] "Or who shut up the sea with doors, When it broke forth from the womb,
[38:9] When I made clouds the garment of it, Thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,
[38:10] Marked out for it my bound, Set bars and doors,
[38:11] And said, 'Here you may come, but no further; Here shall your proud waves be stayed?'
[38:12] "Have you commanded the morning in your days, And caused the dawn to know its place;
[38:13] That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And shake the wicked out of it?
[38:14] It is changed as clay under the seal, And stands forth as a garment.
[38:15] From the wicked, their light is withheld, The high arm is broken.
[38:16] "Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
[38:17] Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
[38:18] Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if you know it all.
[38:19] "What is the way to the dwelling of light? As for darkness, where is the place of it,
[38:20] That you should take it to the bound of it, That you should discern the paths to the house of it?
[38:21] Surely you know, for you were born then, And the number of your days is great!
[38:22] Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, Or have you seen the treasures of the hail,
[38:23] Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?
[38:24] By what way is the lightning distributed, Or the east wind scattered on the earth?
[38:25] Who has cut a channel for the flood water, Or the path for the thunderstorm;
[38:26] To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; On the wilderness, in which there is no man;
[38:27] To satisfy the waste and desolate ground, To cause the tender grass to spring forth?
[38:28] Does the rain have a father? Or who fathers the drops of dew?
[38:29] Out of whose womb came the ice? The gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?
[38:30] The waters become hard like stone, When the surface of the deep is frozen.
[38:31] "Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loosen the cords of Orion?
[38:32] Can you lead forth the constellations in their season? Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
[38:33] Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you establish the dominion of it over the earth?
[38:34] "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover you?
[38:35] Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go? Do they report to you, 'Here we are?'
[38:36] Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind?
[38:37] Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of the sky,
[38:38] When the dust runs into a mass, And the clods of earth stick together?
[38:39] "Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
[38:40] When they crouch in their dens, And lie in wait in the thicket?
[38:41] Who provides for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry to God, And wander for lack of food?

[33:1] Woe to you who destroy, and you weren't destroyed; and deal treacherously, and they didn't deal treacherously with you! When you have ceased to destroy, you shall be destroyed; and when you have made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with you.
[33:2] Yahweh, be gracious to us; we have waited for you: be our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
[33:3] At the noise of the thunder the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of yourself the nations are scattered.
[33:4] Your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathers: as locusts leap shall men leap on it.
[33:5] Yahweh is exalted; for he dwells on high: he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
[33:6] There shall be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Yahweh is your treasure.
[33:7] Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
[33:8] The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: [the enemy] has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he doesn't regard man.
[33:9] The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their leaves].
[33:10] Now will I arise, says Yahweh; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.
[33:11] You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
[33:12] The peoples shall be as the burning of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
[33:13] Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.
[33:14] The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burning?
[33:15] He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from taking a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking on evil:
[33:16] He shall dwell on high; his place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given [him]; his waters shall be sure.
[33:17] Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall see a land that reaches afar.
[33:18] Your heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed [the tribute]? where is he who counted the towers?
[33:19] You shall not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that you can not comprehend, of a strange language that you can not understand.
[33:20] Look on Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes of it shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords of it be broken.
[33:21] But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, in which shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
[33:22] For Yahweh is our judge, Yahweh is our lawgiver, Yahweh is our king; he will save us.
[33:23] Your rigging is untied; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.
[33:24] The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people who dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

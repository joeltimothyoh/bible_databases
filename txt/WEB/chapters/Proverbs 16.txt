[16:1] The plans of the heart belong to man, But the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh.
[16:2] All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Yahweh weighs the motives.
[16:3] Commit your deeds to Yahweh, And your plans shall succeed.
[16:4] Yahweh has made everything for its own end-- Yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.
[16:5] Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh: They shall assuredly not be unpunished.
[16:6] By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for. By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.
[16:7] When a man's ways please Yahweh, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
[16:8] Better is a little with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice.
[16:9] A man's heart plans his course, But Yahweh directs his steps.
[16:10] Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king. He shall not betray his mouth.
[16:11] Honest balances and scales are Yahweh's; All the weights in the bag are his work.
[16:12] It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, For the throne is established by righteousness.
[16:13] Righteous lips are the delight of kings. They value one who speaks the truth.
[16:14] The king's wrath is a messenger of death, But a wise man will pacify it.
[16:15] In the light of the king's face is life. His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.
[16:16] How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
[16:17] The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
[16:18] Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.
[16:19] It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the plunder with the proud.
[16:20] He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed.
[16:21] The wise in heart shall be called prudent. Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.
[16:22] Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, But the punishment of fools is their folly.
[16:23] The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, And adds learning to his lips.
[16:24] Pleasant words are a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
[16:25] There is a way which seems right to a man, But in the end it leads to death.
[16:26] The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; For his mouth urges him on.
[16:27] A worthless man devises mischief. His speech is like a scorching fire.
[16:28] A perverse man stirs up strife. A whisperer separates close friends.
[16:29] A man of violence entices his neighbor, And leads him in a way that is not good.
[16:30] One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, One who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.
[16:31] Gray hair is a crown of glory. It is attained by a life of righteousness.
[16:32] One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; One who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.
[16:33] The lot is cast into the lap, But its every decision is from Yahweh.

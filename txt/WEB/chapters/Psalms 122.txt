[122:1] &gt; I was glad when they said to me, "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
[122:2] Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
[122:3] Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
[122:4] Where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, According to an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
[122:5] For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of David's house.
[122:6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those who love you will prosper.
[122:7] Peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces.
[122:8] For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say, "Peace be within you."
[122:9] For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.

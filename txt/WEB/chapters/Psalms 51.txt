[51:1] &gt; Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
[51:2] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin.
[51:3] For I know my transgressions. My sin is constantly before me.
[51:4] Against you, and you only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in your sight; That you may be proved right when you speak, And justified when you judge.
[51:5] Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity. In sin my mother conceived me.
[51:6] Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
[51:7] Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
[51:8] Let me hear joy and gladness, That the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
[51:9] Hide your face from my sins, And blot out all of my iniquities.
[51:10] Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me.
[51:11] Don't throw me from your presence, And don't take your holy Spirit from me.
[51:12] Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Uphold me with a willing spirit.
[51:13] Then I will teach transgressors your ways. Sinners shall be converted to you.
[51:14] Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation. My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
[51:15] Lord, open my lips. My mouth shall declare your praise.
[51:16] For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
[51:17] The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
[51:18] Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem.
[51:19] Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, In burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar.

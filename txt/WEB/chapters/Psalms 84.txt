[84:1] &gt; How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Hosts!
[84:2] My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
[84:3] Yes, the sparrow has found a home, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, Near your altars, Yahweh of Hosts, my King, and my God.
[84:4] Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. Selah.
[84:5] Blessed are those whose strength is in you; Who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.
[84:6] Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
[84:7] They go from strength to strength. Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.
[84:8] Yahweh, God of hosts, hear my prayer. Listen, God of Jacob. Selah.
[84:9] Behold, God our shield, Look at the face of your anointed.
[84:10] For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
[84:11] For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory. He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.
[84:12] Yahweh of Hosts, Blessed is the man who trusts in you.

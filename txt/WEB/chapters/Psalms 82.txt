[82:1] &gt; God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods.
[82:2] "How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked?" Selah.
[82:3] "Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
[82:4] Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked."
[82:5] They don't know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
[82:6] I said, "You are gods, All of you are sons of the Most High.
[82:7] Nevertheless you shall die like men, And fall like one of the rulers."
[82:8] Arise, God, judge the earth, For you inherit all of the nations.

[49:1] &gt; Hear this, all you peoples. Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,
[49:2] Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
[49:3] My mouth will speak words of wisdom. My heart shall utter understanding.
[49:4] I will incline my ear to a proverb. I will open my riddle on the harp.
[49:5] Why should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
[49:6] Those who trust in their wealth, And boast in the multitude of their riches--
[49:7] None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give God a ransom for him.
[49:8] For the redemption of their life is costly, No payment is ever enough,
[49:9] That he should live on forever, That he should not see corruption.
[49:10] For he sees that wise men die; Likewise the fool and the senseless perish, And leave their wealth to others.
[49:11] Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever, And their dwelling places to all generations. They name their lands after themselves.
[49:12] But man, despite his riches, doesn't endure. He is like the animals that perish.
[49:13] This is the destiny of those who are foolish, And of those who approve their sayings. Selah.
[49:14] They are appointed as a flock for Sheol. Death shall be their shepherd. The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. Their beauty shall decay in Sheol, Far from their mansion.
[49:15] But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, For he will receive me. Selah.
[49:16] Don't be afraid when a man is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.
[49:17] For when he dies he shall carry nothing away. His glory shall not descend after him.
[49:18] Though while he lived he blessed his soul-- And men praise you when you do well for yourself--
[49:19] He shall go to the generation of his fathers. They shall never see the light.
[49:20] A man who has riches without understanding, Is like the animals that perish.

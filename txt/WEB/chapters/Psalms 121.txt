[121:1] &gt; I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from?
[121:2] My help comes from Yahweh, Who made heaven and earth.
[121:3] He will not allow your foot to be moved. He who keeps you will not slumber.
[121:4] Behold, he who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.
[121:5] Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
[121:6] The sun will not harm you by day, Nor the moon by night.
[121:7] Yahweh will keep you from all evil. He will keep your soul.
[121:8] Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, From this time forth, and forevermore.

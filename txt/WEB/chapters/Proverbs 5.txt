[5:1] My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding:
[5:2] That you may maintain discretion, That your lips may preserve knowledge.
[5:3] For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,
[5:4] But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, And as sharp as a two-edged sword.
[5:5] Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
[5:6] She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn't know it.
[5:7] Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don't depart from the words of my mouth.
[5:8] Remove your way far from her. Don't come near the door of her house,
[5:9] Lest you give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel one;
[5:10] Lest strangers feast on your wealth, And your labors enrich another man's house.
[5:11] You will groan at your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,
[5:12] And say, "How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;
[5:13] Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!
[5:14] I have come to the brink of utter ruin, In the midst of the gathered assembly."
[5:15] Drink water out of your own cistern, Running water out of your own well.
[5:16] Should your springs overflow in the streets, Streams of water in the public squares?
[5:17] Let them be for yourself alone, Not for strangers with you.
[5:18] Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[5:19] A loving doe and a graceful deer-- Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love.
[5:20] For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another?
[5:21] For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh. He examines all his paths.
[5:22] The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly.
[5:23] He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.

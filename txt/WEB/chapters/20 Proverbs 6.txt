[6:1] My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, If you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;
[6:2] You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.
[6:3] Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, Seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor.
[6:4] Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids.
[6:5] Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, Like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
[6:6] Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;
[6:7] Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
[6:8] Provides her bread in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest.
[6:9] How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?
[6:10] A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:
[6:11] So your poverty will come as a robber, And your scarcity as an armed man.
[6:12] A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;
[6:13] Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, Who motions with his fingers;
[6:14] In whose heart is perverseness, Who devises evil continually, Who always sows discord.
[6:15] Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
[6:16] There are six things which Yahweh hates; Yes, seven which are an abomination to him:
[6:17] Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood;
[6:18] A heart that devises wicked schemes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
[6:19] A false witness who utters lies, And he who sows discord among brothers.
[6:20] My son, keep your father's commandment, And don't forsake your mother's teaching.
[6:21] Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.
[6:22] When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.
[6:23] For the commandment is a lamp, And the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
[6:24] To keep you from the immoral woman, From the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue.
[6:25] Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, Neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.
[6:26] For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
[6:27] Can a man scoop fire into his lap, And his clothes not be burned?
[6:28] Or can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?
[6:29] So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.
[6:30] Men don't despise a thief, If he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:
[6:31] But if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.
[6:32] He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.
[6:33] He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.
[6:34] For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won't spare in the day of vengeance.
[6:35] He won't regard any ransom, Neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.

[92:1] &gt; It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, To sing praises to your name, Most High;
[92:2] To proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, And your faithfulness every night,
[92:3] With the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, And with the melody of the lyre.
[92:4] For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.
[92:5] How great are your works, Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep.
[92:6] A senseless man doesn't know, Neither does a fool understand this:
[92:7] Though the wicked spring up as the grass, And all the evil-doers flourish, They will be destroyed forever.
[92:8] But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.
[92:9] For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, For, behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evil-doers will be scattered.
[92:10] But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil.
[92:11] My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.
[92:12] The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
[92:13] They are planted in Yahweh's house. They will flourish in our God's courts.
[92:14] They will still bring forth fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green,
[92:15] To show that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, And there is no unrighteousness in him.

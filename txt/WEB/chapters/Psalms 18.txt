[18:1] &gt; I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
[18:2] Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
[18:3] I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; And I am saved from my enemies.
[18:4] The cords of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
[18:5] The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came on me.
[18:6] In my distress I called on Yahweh, And cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple, My cry before him came into his ears.
[18:7] Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, Because he was angry.
[18:8] Smoke went out of his nostrils. Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.
[18:9] He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.
[18:10] He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.
[18:11] He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion around him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
[18:12] At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.
[18:13] Yahweh also thundered in the sky, The Most High uttered his voice: Hailstones and coals of fire.
[18:14] He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.
[18:15] Then the channels of waters appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
[18:16] He sent from on high. He took me. He drew me out of many waters.
[18:17] He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
[18:18] They came on me in the day of my calamity, But Yahweh was my support.
[18:19] He brought me forth also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
[18:20] Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
[18:21] For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
[18:22] For all his ordinances were before me. I didn't put away his statutes from me.
[18:23] I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my iniquity.
[18:24] Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
[18:25] With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
[18:26] With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
[18:27] For you will save the afflicted people, But the haughty eyes you will bring down.
[18:28] For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. My God will light up my darkness.
[18:29] For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.
[18:30] As for God, his way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
[18:31] For who is God, except Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God,
[18:32] The God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
[18:33] He makes my feet like deer's feet, And sets me on my high places.
[18:34] He teaches my hands to war; So that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
[18:35] You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me great.
[18:36] You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.
[18:37] I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.
[18:38] I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.
[18:39] For you have girded me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
[18:40] You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, That I might cut off those who hate me.
[18:41] They cried, but there was none to save; Even to Yahweh, but he didn't answer them.
[18:42] Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
[18:43] You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
[18:44] As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
[18:45] The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.
[18:46] Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my salvation,
[18:47] Even the God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me.
[18:48] He rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.
[18:49] Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, And will sing praises to your name.
[18:50] He gives great deliverance to his king, And shows loving kindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, forevermore.

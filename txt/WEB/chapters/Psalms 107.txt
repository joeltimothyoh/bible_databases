[107:1] Give thanks to Yahweh, For he is good, For his loving kindness endures forever.
[107:2] Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, Whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
[107:3] And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.
[107:4] They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.
[107:5] Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.
[107:6] Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,
[107:7] He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city to live in.
[107:8] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:9] For he satisfies the longing soul. He fills the hungry soul with good.
[107:10] Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,
[107:11] Because they rebelled against the words of God, And condemned the counsel of the Most High.
[107:12] Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.
[107:13] Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.
[107:14] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their bonds in sunder.
[107:15] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:16] For he has broken the gates of brass, And cut through bars of iron.
[107:17] Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, And because of their iniquities.
[107:18] Their soul abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death.
[107:19] Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, He saves them out of their distresses.
[107:20] He sends his word, and heals them, And delivers them from their graves.
[107:21] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, For his wonderful works to the children of men!
[107:22] Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.
[107:23] Those who go down to the sea in ships, Who do business in great waters;
[107:24] These see Yahweh's works, And his wonders in the deep.
[107:25] For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up its waves.
[107:26] They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.
[107:27] They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end.
[107:28] Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, And he brings them out of their distress.
[107:29] He makes the storm a calm, So that its waves are still.
[107:30] Then they are glad because it is calm, So he brings them to their desired haven.
[107:31] Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, For his wonderful works for the children of men!
[107:32] Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.
[107:33] He turns rivers into a desert, Water springs into a thirsty ground,
[107:34] And a fruitful land into a salt waste, For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
[107:35] He turns a desert into a pool of water, And a dry land into water springs.
[107:36] There he makes the hungry live, That they may prepare a city to live in,
[107:37] Sow fields, plant vineyards, And reap the fruits of increase.
[107:38] He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He doesn't allow their cattle to decrease.
[107:39] Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
[107:40] He pours contempt on princes, And causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
[107:41] Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, And increases their families like a flock.
[107:42] The upright will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths.
[107:43] Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.

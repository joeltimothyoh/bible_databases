[8:1] Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
[8:2] "How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
[8:3] Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
[8:4] If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience;
[8:5] If you want to seek God diligently, Make your supplication to the Almighty.
[8:6] If you were pure and upright, Surely now he would awaken for you, And make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
[8:7] Though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would greatly increase.
[8:8] "Please inquire of past generations, Find out about the learning of their fathers.
[8:9] (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days on earth are a shadow.)
[8:10] Shall they not teach you, tell you, And utter words out of their heart?
[8:11] "Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?
[8:12] While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, It withers before any other reed.
[8:13] So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,
[8:14] Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider's web.
[8:15] He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.
[8:16] He is green before the sun, His shoots go forth over his garden.
[8:17] His roots are wrapped around the rock pile, He sees the place of stones.
[8:18] If he is destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, saying, 'I have not seen you.'
[8:19] Behold, this is the joy of his way: Out of the earth shall others spring.
[8:20] "Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.
[8:21] He will still fill your mouth with laughter, Your lips with shouting.
[8:22] Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more."

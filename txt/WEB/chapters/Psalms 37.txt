[37:1] &gt; Don't fret because of evil-doers, Neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.
[37:2] For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither like the green herb.
[37:3] Trust in Yahweh, and do good. Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.
[37:4] Also delight yourself in Yahweh, And he will give you the desires of your heart.
[37:5] Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in him, and he will do this:
[37:6] He will make your righteousness go forth as the light, And your justice as the noon day sun.
[37:7] Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him. Don't fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.
[37:8] Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Don't fret, it leads only to evildoing.
[37:9] For evildoers shall be cut off, But those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.
[37:10] For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Yes, though you look for his place, he isn't there.
[37:11] But the humble shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
[37:12] The wicked plots against the just, And gnashes at him with his teeth.
[37:13] The Lord will laugh at him, For he sees that his day is coming.
[37:14] The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To kill those who are upright in the way.
[37:15] Their sword shall enter into their own heart. Their bows shall be broken.
[37:16] Better is a little that the righteous has, Than the abundance of many wicked.
[37:17] For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, But Yahweh upholds the righteous.
[37:18] Yahweh knows the days of the perfect. Their inheritance shall be forever.
[37:19] They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
[37:20] But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields. They will vanish-- Vanish like smoke.
[37:21] The wicked borrow, and don't pay back, But the righteous give generously.
[37:22] For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land. Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.
[37:23] A man's goings are established by Yahweh. He delights in his way.
[37:24] Though he stumble, he shall not fall, For Yahweh holds him up with his hand.
[37:25] I have been young, and now am old, Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his children begging for bread.
[37:26] All day long he deals graciously, and lends. His seed is blessed.
[37:27] Depart from evil, and do good; Live securely forever.
[37:28] For Yahweh loves justice, And doesn't forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, But the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
[37:29] The righteous shall inherit the land, And live in it forever.
[37:30] The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. His tongue speaks justice.
[37:31] The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide.
[37:32] The wicked watches the righteous, And seeks to kill him.
[37:33] Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.
[37:34] Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, And he will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
[37:35] I have seen the wicked in great power, Spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
[37:36] But he passed away, and, behold, he was not. Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.
[37:37] Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, For there is a future for the man of peace.
[37:38] As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
[37:39] But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh. He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
[37:40] Yahweh helps them, and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.

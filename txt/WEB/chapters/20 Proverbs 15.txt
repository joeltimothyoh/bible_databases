[15:1] A gentle answer turns away wrath, But a harsh word stirs up anger.
[15:2] The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, But the mouth of fools gush out folly.
[15:3] Yahweh's eyes are everywhere, Keeping watch on the evil and the good.
[15:4] A gentle tongue is a tree of life, But deceit in it crushes the spirit.
[15:5] A fool despises his father's correction, But he who heeds reproof shows prudence.
[15:6] In the house of the righteous is much treasure, But the income of the wicked brings trouble.
[15:7] The lips of the wise spread knowledge; Not so with the heart of fools.
[15:8] The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, But the prayer of the upright is his delight.
[15:9] The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, But he loves him who follows after righteousness.
[15:10] There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way: Whoever hates reproof shall die.
[15:11] Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh-- How much more then the hearts of the children of men!
[15:12] A scoffer doesn't love to be reproved; He will not go to the wise.
[15:13] A glad heart makes a cheerful face; But an aching heart breaks the spirit.
[15:14] The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge, But the mouths of fools feed on folly.
[15:15] All the days of the afflicted are wretched, But one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
[15:16] Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, Than great treasure with trouble.
[15:17] Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, Than a fattened calf with hatred.
[15:18] A wrathful man stirs up contention, But one who is slow to anger appeases strife.
[15:19] The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, But the path of the upright is a highway.
[15:20] A wise son makes a father glad, But a foolish man despises his mother.
[15:21] Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, But a man of understanding keeps his way straight.
[15:22] Where there is no counsel, plans fail; But in a multitude of counselors they are established.
[15:23] Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth. How good is a word at the right time!
[15:24] The path of life leads upward for the wise, To keep him from going downward to Sheol.
[15:25] Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, But he will keep the widow's borders intact.
[15:26] Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, But the thoughts of the pure are pleasing.
[15:27] He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, But he who hates bribes will live.
[15:28] The heart of the righteous weighs answers, But the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil.
[15:29] Yahweh is far from the wicked, But he hears the prayer of the righteous.
[15:30] The light of the eyes rejoices the heart. Good news gives health to the bones.
[15:31] The ear that listens to reproof lives, And will be at home among the wise.
[15:32] He who refuses correction despises his own soul, But he who listens to reproof gets understanding.
[15:33] The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom. Before honor is humility.

[12:1] &gt; Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
[12:2] Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
[12:3] May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, And the tongue that boasts,
[12:4] Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?"
[12:5] "Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him."
[12:6] The words of Yahweh are flawless words, As silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
[12:7] You will keep them, Yahweh, You will preserve them from this generation forever.
[12:8] The wicked walk on every side, When what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.

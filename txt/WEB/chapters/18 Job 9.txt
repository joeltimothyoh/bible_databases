[9:1] Then Job answered,
[9:2] "Truly I know that it is so, But how can man be just with God?
[9:3] If he is pleased to contend with him, He can't answer him one time in a thousand.
[9:4] God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?
[9:5] Who removes the mountains, and they don't know it, When he overturns them in his anger
[9:6] Who shakes the earth out of its place; The pillars of it tremble;
[9:7] Who commands the sun, and it doesn't rise, And seals up the stars;
[9:8] Who alone stretches out the heavens, Treads on the waves of the sea;
[9:9] Who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;
[9:10] Who does great things past finding out, Yes, marvelous things without number.
[9:11] Behold, he goes by me, and I don't see him. He passes on also, but I don't perceive him.
[9:12] Behold, he snatches away; who can hinder him? Who will ask him, 'What are you doing?'
[9:13] "God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.
[9:14] How much less shall I answer him, Choose my words to argue with him?
[9:15] Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer. I would make supplication to my judge.
[9:16] If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he listened to my voice.
[9:17] For he breaks me with a tempest, Multiplies my wounds without cause.
[9:18] He will not allow me to take my breath, But fills me with bitterness.
[9:19] If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, 'Who,' says he, 'will summon me?'
[9:20] Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.
[9:21] I am blameless. I don't regard myself. I despise my life.
[9:22] "It is all the same. Therefore I say, He destroys the blameless and the wicked.
[9:23] If the scourge kills suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.
[9:24] The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of the judges of it. If not he, then who is it?
[9:25] "Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away, they see no good,
[9:26] They have passed away as the swift ships, As the eagle that swoops on the prey.
[9:27] If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;'
[9:28] I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.
[9:29] I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?
[9:30] If I wash myself with snow, And cleanse my hands with lye,
[9:31] Yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes shall abhor me.
[9:32] For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.
[9:33] There is no umpire between us, That might lay his hand on us both.
[9:34] Let him take his rod away from me, Let his terror not make me afraid:
[9:35] Then I would speak, and not fear him, For I am not so in myself.

[95:1] Oh come, let's sing to Yahweh. Let's shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!
[95:2] Let's come before his presence with thanksgiving. Let's extol him with songs!
[95:3] For Yahweh is a great God, A great King above all gods.
[95:4] In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also his.
[95:5] The sea is his, and he made it. His hands formed the dry land.
[95:6] Oh come, let's worship and bow down. Let's kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,
[95:7] For he is our God. We are the people of his pasture, And the sheep in his care. Today, oh that you would hear his voice!
[95:8] Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
[95:9] When your fathers tempted me, Tested me, and saw my work.
[95:10] Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, And said, "It is a people that errs in their heart. They have not known my ways."
[95:11] Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They won't enter into my rest."

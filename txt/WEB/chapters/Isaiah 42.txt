[42:1] Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delights: I have put my Spirit on him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.
[42:2] He will not cry, nor lift up his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.
[42:3] A bruised reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: he will bring forth justice in truth.
[42:4] He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he have set justice in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.
[42:5] Thus says God Yahweh, he who created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he who spread abroad the earth and that which comes out of it; he who gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to those who walk therein:
[42:6] I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
[42:7] to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.
[42:8] I am Yahweh, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to engraved images.
[42:9] Behold, the former things have happened, and new things do I declare. Before they spring forth I tell you of them.
[42:10] Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants of it.
[42:11] Let the wilderness and the cities of it lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar does inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
[42:12] Let them give glory to Yahweh, and declare his praise in the islands.
[42:13] Yahweh will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up [his] zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yes, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies.
[42:14] I have long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: [now] will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.
[42:15] I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
[42:16] I will bring the blind by a way that they don't know; in paths that they don't know will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them.
[42:17] They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly disappointed, who trust in engraved images, who tell molten images, You are our gods.
[42:18] Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.
[42:19] Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace, and blind as Yahweh's servant?
[42:20] You see many things, but don't observe. His ears are open, but he doesn't hear.
[42:21] It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.
[42:22] But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none says, Restore.
[42:23] Who is there among you who will give ear to this? who will listen and hear for the time to come?
[42:24] Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Didn't Yahweh? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient to his law.
[42:25] Therefore he poured on him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he didn't know; and it burned him, yet he didn't lay it to heart.

[2:1] Woe to those who devise iniquity And work evil on their beds! When the morning is light, they practice it, Because it is in the power of their hand.
[2:2] They covet fields, and seize them; And houses, and take them away: And they oppress a man and his house, Even a man and his heritage.
[2:3] Therefore thus says Yahweh: "Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, From which you will not remove your necks, Neither will you walk haughtily; For it is an evil time.
[2:4] In that day they will take up a parable against you, And lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, 'We are utterly ruined! My people's possession is divided up. Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!'"
[2:5] Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.
[2:6] "Don't you prophesy!" They prophesy. "Don't prophesy about these things. Disgrace won't overtake us."
[2:7] Shall it be said, O house of Jacob: "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these his doings? Don't my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?"
[2:8] But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.
[2:9] You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; From their young children you take away my blessing forever.
[2:10] Arise, and depart! For this is not your resting place, Because of uncleanness that destroys, Even with a grievous destruction.
[2:11] If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies: 'I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;' He would be the prophet of this people.
[2:12] I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, As a flock in the midst of their pasture; They will swarm with people.
[2:13] He who breaks open the way goes up before them. They break through the gate, and go out. And their king passes on before them, With Yahweh at their head."

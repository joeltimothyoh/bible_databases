[12:1] In that day you will say, "I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.
[12:2] Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my salvation."
[12:3] Therefore with joy you shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.
[12:4] In that day you will say, "Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!
[12:5] Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!
[12:6] Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel!"

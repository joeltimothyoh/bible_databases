[135:1] Praise Yah! Praise the name of Yahweh! Praise him, you servants of Yahweh,
[135:2] You who stand in the house of Yahweh, In the courts of our God's house.
[135:3] Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant.
[135:4] For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself; Israel for his own possession.
[135:5] For I know that Yahweh is great, That our Lord is above all gods.
[135:6] Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
[135:7] Who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; Who makes lightnings with the rain; Who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries;
[135:8] Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, Both of man and animal;
[135:9] Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt, On Pharaoh, and on all his servants;
[135:10] Who struck many nations, And killed mighty kings,
[135:11] Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan,
[135:12] And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage to Israel, his people.
[135:13] Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; Your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.
[135:14] For Yahweh will judge his people, And have compassion on his servants.
[135:15] The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
[135:16] They have mouths, but they can't speak; They have eyes, but they can't see;
[135:17] They have ears, but they can't hear; Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
[135:18] Those who make them will be like them; Yes, everyone who trusts in them.
[135:19] House of Israel, praise Yahweh! House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
[135:20] House of Levi, praise Yahweh! You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!
[135:21] Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

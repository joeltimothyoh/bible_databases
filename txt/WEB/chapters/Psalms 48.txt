[48:1] &gt; Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
[48:2] Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion, on the north sides, The city of the great King.
[48:3] God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.
[48:4] For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.
[48:5] They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed, They hurried away.
[48:6] Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail.
[48:7] With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.
[48:8] As we have heard, so we have seen, In the city of Yahweh of Hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.
[48:9] We have thought about your loving kindness, God, In the midst of your temple.
[48:10] As is your name, God, So is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.
[48:11] Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of your judgments.
[48:12] Walk about Zion, and go around her. Number its towers;
[48:13] Mark well her bulwarks. Consider her palaces, That you may tell it to the next generation.
[48:14] For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide even to death.

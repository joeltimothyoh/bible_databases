[7:1] When I would heal Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, Also the wickedness of Samaria; For they commit falsehood, And the thief enters in, And the gang of robbers ravages outside.
[7:2] They don't consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own deeds have engulfed them. They are before my face.
[7:3] They make the king glad with their wickedness, And the princes with their lies.
[7:4] They are all adulterers. They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring, From the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.
[7:5] On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine. He joined his hand with mockers.
[7:6] For they have made ready their heart like an oven, While they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all the night. In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.
[7:7] They are all hot as an oven, And devour their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one among them who calls to me.
[7:8] Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations. Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.
[7:9] Strangers have devoured his strength, And he doesn't realize it. Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, And he doesn't realize it.
[7:10] The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Yet they haven't returned to Yahweh their God, Nor sought him, for all this.
[7:11] "Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria.
[7:12] When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.
[7:13] Woe to them! For they have wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against me. Though I would redeem them, Yet they have spoken lies against me.
[7:14] They haven't cried to me with their heart, But they howl on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and new wine. They turn away from me.
[7:15] Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, Yet they plot evil against me.
[7:16] They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.

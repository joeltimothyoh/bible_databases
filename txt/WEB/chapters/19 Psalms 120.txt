[120:1] &gt; In my distress, I cried to Yahweh. He answered me.
[120:2] Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue.
[120:3] What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you, You deceitful tongue?
[120:4] Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper.
[120:5] Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
[120:6] My soul has had her dwelling too long With him who hates peace.
[120:7] I am for peace, But when I speak, they are for war.

[20:1] &gt; May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,
[20:2] Send you help from the sanctuary, Grant you support from Zion,
[20:3] Remember all your offerings, And accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah.
[20:4] May He grant you your heart's desire, And fulfill all your counsel.
[20:5] We will triumph in your salvation. In the name of our God we will set up our banners: May Yahweh grant all your requests.
[20:6] Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven, With the saving strength of his right hand.
[20:7] Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, But we trust the name of Yahweh our God.
[20:8] They are bowed down and fallen, But we rise up, and stand upright.
[20:9] Save, Yahweh; Let the King answer us when we call!

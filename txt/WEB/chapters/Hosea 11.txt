[11:1] "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, And called my son out of Egypt.
[11:2] They called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, And burned incense to engraved images.
[11:3] Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took them by his arms; But they didn't know that I healed them.
[11:4] I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love; And I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; And I bent down to him and I fed him.
[11:5] "They won't return into the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian will be their king, Because they refused to repent.
[11:6] The sword will fall on their cities, And will consume their gate bars, And will put an end to their plans.
[11:7] My people are determined to turn from me. Though they call to the Most High, He certainly won't exalt them.
[11:8] "How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me, My compassion is aroused.
[11:9] I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to destroy Ephraim: For I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; And I will not come in wrath.
[11:10] They will walk after Yahweh, Who will roar like a lion; For he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west.
[11:11] They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, And like a dove out of the land of Assyria; And I will settle them in their houses," says Yahweh.
[11:12] Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, And the house of Israel with deceit; And Judah still us unruly with God, And is unfaithful to the Holy One.

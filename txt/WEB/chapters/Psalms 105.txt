[105:1] Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! Make his doings known among the peoples.
[105:2] Sing to him, sing praises to him! Tell of all his marvelous works.
[105:3] Glory in his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
[105:4] Seek Yahweh and his strength. Seek his face forever more.
[105:5] Remember his marvelous works that he has done; His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
[105:6] You seed of Abraham, his servant, You children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
[105:7] He is Yahweh, our God. His judgments are in all the earth.
[105:8] He has remembered his covenant forever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
[105:9] The covenant which he made with Abraham, His oath to Isaac,
[105:10] And confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
[105:11] Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;"
[105:12] When they were but a few men in number, Yes, very few, and foreigners in it.
[105:13] They went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.
[105:14] He allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,
[105:15] "Don't touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!"
[105:16] He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.
[105:17] He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave.
[105:18] They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,
[105:19] Until the time that his word happened, And Yahweh's word proved him true.
[105:20] The king sent and freed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
[105:21] He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all of his possessions;
[105:22] To discipline his princes at his pleasure, And to teach his elders wisdom.
[105:23] Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
[105:24] He increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.
[105:25] He turned their heart to hate his people, To conspire against his servants.
[105:26] He sent Moses, his servant, And Aaron, whom he had chosen.
[105:27] They performed miracles among them, And wonders in the land of Ham.
[105:28] He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn't rebel against his words.
[105:29] He turned their waters into blood, And killed their fish.
[105:30] Their land swarmed with frogs, Even in the chambers of their kings.
[105:31] He spoke, and swarms of flies came, And lice in all their borders.
[105:32] He gave them hail for rain, With lightning in their land.
[105:33] He struck their vines and also their fig trees, And shattered the trees of their country.
[105:34] He spoke, and the locusts came, And the grasshoppers, without number,
[105:35] Ate up every plant in their land; And ate up the fruit of their ground.
[105:36] He struck also all the firstborn in their land, The first fruits of all their manhood.
[105:37] He brought them forth with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his tribes.
[105:38] Egypt was glad when they departed, For the fear of them had fallen on them.
[105:39] He spread a cloud for a covering, Fire to give light in the night.
[105:40] They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of the sky.
[105:41] He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.
[105:42] For he remembered his holy word, And Abraham, his servant.
[105:43] He brought forth his people with joy, His chosen with singing.
[105:44] He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,
[105:45] That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise Yah!

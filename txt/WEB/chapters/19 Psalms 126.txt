[126:1] &gt; When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, We were like those who dream.
[126:2] Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great things for them."
[126:3] Yahweh has done great things for us, And we are glad.
[126:4] Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, Like the streams in the Negev.
[126:5] Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
[126:6] He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, Will assuredly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.

[113:1] Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of Yahweh, Praise the name of Yahweh.
[113:2] Blessed be the name of Yahweh, From this time forth and forevermore.
[113:3] From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, Yahweh's name is to be praised.
[113:4] Yahweh is high above all nations, His glory above the heavens.
[113:5] Who is like Yahweh, our God, Who has his seat on high,
[113:6] Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
[113:7] He raises up the poor out of the dust. Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;
[113:8] That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.
[113:9] He settles the barren woman in her home, As a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!

[124:1] &gt; If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, Let Israel now say,
[124:2] If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, When men rose up against us;
[124:3] Then they would have swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;
[124:4] Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our soul;
[124:5] Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
[124:6] Blessed be Yahweh, Who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
[124:7] Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
[124:8] Our help is in the name of Yahweh, Who made heaven and earth.

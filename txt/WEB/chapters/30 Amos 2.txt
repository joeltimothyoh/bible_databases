[2:1] Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime;
[2:2] But I will send a fire on Moab, And it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; And Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;
[2:3] And I will cut off the judge from their midst, And will kill all its princes with him," says Yahweh.
[2:4] Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; Because they have rejected Yahweh's law, And have not kept his statutes, And their lies have led them astray, After which their fathers walked;
[2:5] But I will send a fire on Judah, And it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem."
[2:6] Thus says Yahweh: "For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; Because they have sold the righteous for silver, And the needy for a pair of shoes;
[2:7] They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, And deny justice to the oppressed; And a man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name;
[2:8] And they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge; And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.
[2:9] Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, Whose height was like the height of the cedars, And he was strong as the oaks; Yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
[2:10] Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, And led you forty years in the wilderness, To possess the land of the Amorite.
[2:11] I raised up some of your sons for prophets, And some of your young men for Nazirites. Isn't this true, You children of Israel?" says Yahweh.
[2:12] "But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, And commanded the prophets, saying, 'Don't prophesy!'
[2:13] Behold, I will crush you in your place, As a cart crushes that is full of grain.
[2:14] Flight will perish from the swift; And the strong won't strengthen his force; Neither shall the mighty deliver himself;
[2:15] Neither shall he stand who handles the bow; And he who is swift of foot won't escape; Neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself;
[2:16] And he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked in that day," says Yahweh.

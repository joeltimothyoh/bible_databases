[2:1] Why do the nations rage, And the peoples plot a vain thing?
[2:2] The kings of the earth take a stand, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Yahweh, and against his anointed,{The word "anointed" is the same as the word for "Messiah" or "Christ"} saying,
[2:3] "Let's break their bonds apart, And cast away their cords from us."
[2:4] He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.
[2:5] Then he will speak to them in his anger, And terrify them in his wrath:
[2:6] "Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."
[2:7] I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, "You are my son. Today I have become your father.
[2:8] Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, The uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
[2:9] You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
[2:10] Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
[2:11] Serve Yahweh with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
[2:12] Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

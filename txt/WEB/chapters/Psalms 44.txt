[44:1] &gt; We have heard with our ears, God; Our fathers have told us, What work you did in their days, In the days of old.
[44:2] You drove out the nations with your hand, But you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, But you spread them abroad.
[44:3] For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, Because you were favorable to them.
[44:4] You are my King, God. Command victories for Jacob!
[44:5] Through you, will we push down our adversaries. Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us.
[44:6] For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me.
[44:7] But you have saved us from our adversaries, And have shamed those who hate us.
[44:8] In God we have made our boast all day long, We will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.
[44:9] But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, And don't go out with our armies.
[44:10] You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take spoil for themselves.
[44:11] You have made us like sheep for food, And have scattered us among the nations.
[44:12] You sell your people for nothing, And have gained nothing from their sale.
[44:13] You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
[44:14] You make us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.
[44:15] All day long my dishonor is before me, And shame covers my face,
[44:16] At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, Because of the enemy and the avenger.
[44:17] All this has come on us, Yet have we not forgotten you, Neither have we been false to your covenant.
[44:18] Our heart has not turned back, Neither have our steps strayed from your path,
[44:19] Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
[44:20] If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
[44:21] Won't God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
[44:22] Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.
[44:23] Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise! Don't reject us forever.
[44:24] Why do you hide your face, And forget our affliction and our oppression?
[44:25] For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body cleaves to the earth.
[44:26] Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake.

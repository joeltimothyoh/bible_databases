[8:1] Oh that you were like my brother, Who sucked the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I would kiss you; Yes, and no one would despise me.
[8:2] I would lead you, bringing you into my mother's house, Who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate.
[8:3] His left hand would be under my head. His right hand would embrace me.
[8:4] I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, That you not stir up, nor awaken love, Until it so desires.  Friends
[8:5] Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, Leaning on her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you. There your mother conceived you. There she was in labor and bore you.
[8:6] Set me as a seal on your heart, As a seal on your arm; For love is strong as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; Its flashes are flashes of fire, A very flame of Yahweh.
[8:7] Many waters can't quench love, Neither can floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, He would be utterly scorned.  Friends
[8:8] We have a little sister. She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister In the day when she is to be spoken for?
[8:9] If she is a wall, We will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door, We will enclose her with boards of cedar.  Beloved
[8:10] I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, Then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.
[8:11] Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
[8:12] My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are for you, Solomon; Two hundred for those who tend its fruit.  Lover
[8:13] You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, Let me hear your voice!  Beloved
[8:14] Come away, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!

[58:1] &gt; Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?
[58:2] No, in your heart you plot injustice. You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.
[58:3] The wicked go astray from the womb. They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
[58:4] Their poison is like the poison of a snake; Like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,
[58:5] Which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers, No matter how skillful the charmer may be.
[58:6] Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
[58:7] Let them vanish as water that flows away. When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.
[58:8] Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, Like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.
[58:9] Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, He will sweep away the green and the burning alike.
[58:10] The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
[58:11] So that men shall say, "Most assuredly there is a reward for the righteous. Most assuredly there is a God who judges the earth."

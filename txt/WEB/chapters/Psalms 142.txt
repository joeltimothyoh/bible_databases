[142:1] &gt; I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
[142:2] I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles.
[142:3] When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, You knew my path. In the way in which I walk, They have hidden a snare for me.
[142:4] Look on my right, and see; For there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul.
[142:5] I cried to you, Yahweh. I said, "You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living."
[142:6] Listen to my cry, For I am in desperate need. Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
[142:7] Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, For you will be good to me.

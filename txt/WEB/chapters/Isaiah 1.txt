[1:1] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
[1:2] Hear, heavens, And listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against me.
[1:3] The ox knows his owner, And the donkey his master's crib; But Israel doesn't know, My people don't consider.
[1:4] Ah sinful nation, A people loaded with iniquity, A seed of evil-doers, Children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Yahweh. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged and backward.
[1:5] Why should you be beaten more, That you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faint.
[1:6] From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it: Wounds, welts, and open sores. They haven't been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
[1:7] Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Strangers devour your land in your presence, And it is desolate, As overthrown by strangers.
[1:8] The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, Like a hut in a field of melons, Like a besieged city.
[1:9] Unless Yahweh of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, We would have been as Sodom; We would have been like Gomorrah.
[1:10] Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
[1:11] "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says Yahweh. "I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, And the fat of fed animals. I don't delight in the blood of bulls, Or of lambs, Or of male goats.
[1:12] When you come to appear before me, Who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
[1:13] Bring no more vain offerings. Incense is an abomination to me; New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations: I can't bear with evil assemblies.
[1:14] My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts; They are a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them.
[1:15] When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.
[1:16] Wash yourselves, make yourself clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; Cease to do evil.
[1:17] Learn to do well. Seek justice, Relieve the oppressed, Judge the fatherless, Plead for the widow."
[1:18] "Come now, and let us reason together," says Yahweh: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
[1:19] If you are willing and obedient, You shall eat the good of the land;
[1:20] But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
[1:21] How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her, But now murderers.
[1:22] Your silver has become dross, Your wine mixed with water.
[1:23] Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They don't judge the fatherless, Neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
[1:24] Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, The Mighty One of Israel, says: "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries, And avenge myself of my enemies;
[1:25] And I will turn my hand on you, Thoroughly purge away your dross, And will take away all your tin.
[1:26] I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called 'The city of righteousness, A faithful town.'
[1:27] Zion shall be redeemed with justice, And her converts with righteousness.
[1:28] But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, And those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
[1:29] For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, And you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
[1:30] For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, And as a garden that has no water.
[1:31] The strong will be like tinder, And his work like a spark. They will both burn together, And no one will quench them."

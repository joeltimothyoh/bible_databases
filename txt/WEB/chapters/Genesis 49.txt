[49:5] "Simeon and Levi are brothers; Weapons of violence are their swords.
[49:6] My soul, don't come into their council; My glory, don't be united to their assembly; For in their anger they killed a man, In their self-will they hamstrung an ox.
[49:7] Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, Scatter them in Israel.
[49:8] "Judah, your brothers will praise you: Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons will bow down before you.

[49:10] The scepter will not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until he comes to whom it belongs. To him will the obedience of the peoples be.

[49:12] His eyes will be red with wine, His teeth white with milk.
[49:13] "Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea. He will be for a haven of ships. His border will be on Sidon.
[49:14] "Issachar is a strong donkey, Lying down between the saddlebags.
[49:15] He saw a resting-place, that it was good, The land, that it was pleasant; He bows his shoulder to the burden, And becomes a servant doing forced labor.

[49:22] "Joseph is a fruitful vine, A fruitful vine by a spring; His branches run over the wall.
[49:23] The archers have sorely grieved him, Shot at him, and persecute him:
[49:24] But his bow abode in strength, The arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
[49:25] Even by the God of your father, who will help you, By the Almighty, who will bless you, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies below, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.

[49:29] He charged them, and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
[49:30] in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.
[49:31] There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:
[49:32] the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth."
[49:33] When Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.

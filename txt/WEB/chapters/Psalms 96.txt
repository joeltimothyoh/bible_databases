[96:1] Sing to Yahweh a new song! Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
[96:2] Sing to Yahweh! Bless his name! Proclaim his salvation from day to day!
[96:3] Declare his glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples.
[96:4] For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised! He is to be feared above all gods.
[96:5] For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But Yahweh made the heavens.
[96:6] Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
[96:7] Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, Ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
[96:8] Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
[96:9] Worship Yahweh in holy array. Tremble before him, all the earth.
[96:10] Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns." The world is also established. It can't be moved. He will judge the peoples with equity.
[96:11] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and it's fullness!
[96:12] Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy
[96:13] Before Yahweh; for he comes, For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, The peoples with his truth.

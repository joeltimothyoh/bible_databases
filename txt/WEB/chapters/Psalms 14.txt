[14:1] &gt; The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none who does good.
[14:2] Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, To see if there were any who did understand, Who did seek after God.
[14:3] They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is none who does good, no, not one.
[14:4] Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And don't call on Yahweh?
[14:5] There they were in great fear, For God is in the generation of the righteous.
[14:6] You frustrate the plan of the poor, Because Yahweh is his refuge.
[14:7] Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, Then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

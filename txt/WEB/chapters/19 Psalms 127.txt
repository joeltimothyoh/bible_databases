[127:1] &gt; Unless Yahweh builds the house, They labor in vain who build it. Unless Yahweh watches over the city, The watchman guards it in vain.
[127:2] It is vain for you to rise up early, To stay up late, Eating the bread of toil; For he gives sleep to his loved ones.
[127:3] Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh. The fruit of the womb is his reward.
[127:4] As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth.
[127:5] Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

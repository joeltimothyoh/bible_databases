[144:1] &gt; Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, Who teaches my hands to war, And my fingers to battle:
[144:2] My loving kindness, my fortress, My high tower, my deliverer, My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdues my people under me.
[144:3] Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him? Or the son of man, that you think of him?
[144:4] Man is like a breath. His days are like a shadow that passes away.
[144:5] Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
[144:6] Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out your arrows, and rout them.
[144:7] Stretch out your hand from above, Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hands of foreigners;
[144:8] Whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
[144:9] I will sing a new song to you, God. On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.
[144:10] You are he who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.
[144:11] Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, Whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
[144:12] Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, Our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
[144:13] Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
[144:14] Our oxen will pull heavy loads. There is no breaking in, and no going away, And no outcry in our streets.
[144:15] Happy are the people who are in such a situation. Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.

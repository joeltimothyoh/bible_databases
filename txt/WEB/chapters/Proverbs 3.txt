[3:1] My son, don't forget my teaching; But let your heart keep my commandments:
[3:2] For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to you.
[3:3] Don't let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.
[3:4] So you will find favor, And good understanding in the sight of God and man.
[3:5] Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, And don't lean on your own understanding.
[3:6] In all your ways acknowledge him, And he will direct your paths.
[3:7] Don't be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
[3:8] It will be health to your body, And nourishment to your bones.
[3:9] Honor Yahweh with your substance, With the first fruits of all your increase:
[3:10] So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine.
[3:11] My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, Neither be weary of his reproof:
[3:12] For whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; Even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.
[3:13] Happy is the man who finds wisdom, The man who gets understanding.
[3:14] For her good profit is better than getting silver, And her return is better than fine gold.
[3:15] She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
[3:16] Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.
[3:17] Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.
[3:18] She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.
[3:19] By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens.
[3:20] By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.
[3:21] My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
[3:22] So they will be life to your soul, And grace for your neck.
[3:23] Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won't stumble.
[3:24] When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
[3:25] Don't be afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:
[3:26] For Yahweh will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being taken.
[3:27] Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do it.
[3:28] Don't say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, Tomorrow I will give it to you," When you have it by you.
[3:29] Don't devise evil against your neighbor, Seeing he dwells securely by you.
[3:30] Don't strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm.
[3:31] Don't envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.
[3:32] For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, But his friendship is with the upright.
[3:33] Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
[3:34] Surely he mocks the mockers, But he gives grace to the humble.
[3:35] The wise will inherit glory, But shame will be the promotion of fools.

[132:1] &gt; Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,
[132:2] How he swore to Yahweh, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
[132:3] "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, Nor go up into my bed;
[132:4] I will not give sleep to my eyes, Or slumber to my eyelids;
[132:5] Until I find out a place for Yahweh, A dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."
[132:6] Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar:
[132:7] "We will go into his dwelling place. We will worship at his footstool.
[132:8] Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; You, and the ark of your strength.
[132:9] Let your priest be clothed with righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy!"
[132:10] For your servant David's sake, Don't turn away the face of your anointed one.
[132:11] Yahweh has sworn to David in truth. He will not turn from it: "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
[132:12] If your children will keep my covenant, My testimony that I will teach them, Their children also will sit on your throne forevermore."
[132:13] For Yahweh has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.
[132:14] "This is my resting place forever. Here I will live, for I have desired it.
[132:15] I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.
[132:16] Her priests I will also clothe with salvation. Her saints will shout aloud for joy.
[132:17] There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
[132:18] I will clothe his enemies with shame, But on himself, his crown will be resplendant."

[94:1] Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, You God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.
[94:2] Rise up, you judge of the earth. Pay back the proud what they deserve.
[94:3] Yahweh, how long will the wicked, How long will the wicked triumph?
[94:4] They pour out arrogant words. All the evil-doers boast.
[94:5] They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, And afflict your heritage.
[94:6] They kill the widow and the alien, And murder the fatherless.
[94:7] They say, "Yah will not see, Neither will Jacob's God consider."
[94:8] Consider, you senseless among the people; You fools, when will you be wise?
[94:9] He who implanted the ear, won't he hear? He who formed the eye, won't he see?
[94:10] He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish? He who teaches man knows.
[94:11] Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, That they are futile.
[94:12] Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, And teach out of your law;
[94:13] That you may give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit is dug for the wicked.
[94:14] For Yahweh won't reject his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
[94:15] For judgment will return to righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it.
[94:16] Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evil-doers?
[94:17] Unless Yahweh had been my help, My soul would have soon lived in silence.
[94:18] When I said, "My foot is slipping!" Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.
[94:19] In the multitude of my thoughts within me, Your comforts delight my soul.
[94:20] Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, Which brings about mischief by statute?
[94:21] They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.
[94:22] But Yahweh has been my high tower, My God, the rock of my refuge.
[94:23] He has brought on them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness. Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.

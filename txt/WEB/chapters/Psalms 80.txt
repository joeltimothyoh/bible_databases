[80:1] &gt; Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock, You who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
[80:2] Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!
[80:3] Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, And we will be saved.
[80:4] Yahweh God of hosts, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
[80:5] You have fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.
[80:6] You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.
[80:7] Turn us again, God of hosts. Cause your face to shine, And we will be saved.
[80:8] You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it.
[80:9] You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.
[80:10] The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God's cedars.
[80:11] It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
[80:12] Why have you broken down its walls, So that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
[80:13] The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.
[80:14] Turn again, we beg you, God of hosts. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,
[80:15] The stock which your right hand planted, The branch that you made strong for yourself.
[80:16] It's burned with fire. It's cut down. They perish at your rebuke.
[80:17] Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, On the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
[80:18] So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.
[80:19] Turn us again, Yahweh God of hosts. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

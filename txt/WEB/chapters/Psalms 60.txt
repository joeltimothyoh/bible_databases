[60:1] &gt; God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again.
[60:2] You have made the land tremble. You have torn it. Mend its fractures, For it quakes.
[60:3] You have shown your people hard things. You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.
[60:4] You have given a banner to those who fear you, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
[60:5] So that your beloved may be delivered, Save with your right hand, and answer us.
[60:6] God has spoken from his sanctuary: "I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, And measure out the valley of Succoth.
[60:7] Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.
[60:8] Moab is my wash basin. I will throw my shoe on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia."
[60:9] Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom?
[60:10] Haven't you, God, rejected us? You don't go out with our armies, God.
[60:11] Give us help against the adversary, For the help of man is vain.
[60:12] Through God we shall do valiantly, For it is he who will tread down our adversaries.

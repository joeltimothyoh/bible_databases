[24:1] &gt; The earth is Yahweh's, with its fullness; The world, and those who dwell therein.
[24:2] For he has founded it on the seas, And established it on the floods.
[24:3] Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill? Who may stand in his holy place?
[24:4] He who has clean hands and a pure heart; Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, And has not sworn deceitfully.
[24:5] He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.
[24:6] This is the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek your face--even Jacob. Selah.
[24:7] Lift up your heads, you gates; Be lifted up, you everlasting doors: The King of glory will come in.
[24:8] Who is the King of glory? Yahweh strong and mighty, Yahweh mighty in battle.
[24:9] Lift up your heads, you gates; Yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors: The King of glory will come in.
[24:10] Who is this King of glory? Yahweh of Hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.

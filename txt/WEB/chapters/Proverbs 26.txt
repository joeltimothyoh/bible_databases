[26:1] Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool.
[26:2] Like a fluttering sparrow, Like a darting swallow, So the undeserved curse doesn't come to rest.
[26:3] A whip for the horse, A bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the back of fools!
[26:4] Don't answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also be like him.
[26:5] Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
[26:6] One who sends a message by the hand of a fool Is cutting off feet and drinking violence.
[26:7] Like the legs of the lame that hang loose: So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
[26:8] As one who binds a stone in a sling, So is he who gives honor to a fool.
[26:9] Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
[26:10] As an archer who wounds all, So is he who hires a fool Or he who hires those who pass by.
[26:11] As a dog that returns to his vomit, So is a fool who repeats his folly.
[26:12] Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
[26:13] The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road! A fierce lion roams the streets!"
[26:14] As the door turns on its hinges, So does the sluggard on his bed.
[26:15] The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
[26:16] The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who answer with discretion.
[26:17] Like one who grabs a dog's ears Is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.
[26:18] Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,
[26:19] Is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not joking?"
[26:20] For lack of wood a fire goes out; Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.
[26:21] As coals are to hot embers, And wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindling strife.
[26:22] The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, They go down into the innermost parts.
[26:23] Like silver dross on an earthen vessel Are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.
[26:24] A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, But he harbors evil in his heart.
[26:25] When his speech is charming, don't believe him; For there are seven abominations in his heart:
[26:26] His malice may be concealed by deception, But his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
[26:27] Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.
[26:28] A lying tongue hates those it hurts; And a flattering mouth works ruin.

[14:1] "Man, who is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.
[14:2] He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn't continue.
[14:3] Do you open your eyes on such a one, And bring me into judgment with you?
[14:4] Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.
[14:5] Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with you, And you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass;
[14:6] Look away from him, that he may rest, Until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
[14:7] "For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, That the tender branch of it will not cease.
[14:8] Though the root of it grows old in the earth, And the stock of it dies in the ground;
[14:9] Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.
[14:10] But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?
[14:11] As the waters fail from the sea, And the river wastes and dries up,
[14:12] So man lies down and doesn't rise; Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.
[14:13] "Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, That you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, That you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!
[14:14] If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Until my release should come.
[14:15] You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire to the work of your hands.
[14:16] But now you number my steps. Don't you watch over my sin?
[14:17] My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity.
[14:18] "But the mountain falling comes to nothing; The rock is removed out of its place;
[14:19] The waters wear the stones; The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth: So you destroy the hope of man.
[14:20] You forever prevail against him, and he passes; You change his face, and send him away.
[14:21] His sons come to honor, and he doesn't know it; They are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them.
[14:22] But his flesh on him has pain; His soul within him mourns."

[14:1] Israel, return to Yahweh your God; For you have fallen because of your sin.
[14:2] Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. Tell him, "Forgive all our sins, And accept that which is good: So we offer like bulls our lips.
[14:3] Assyria can't save us. We won't ride on horses; Neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, 'Our gods!' For in you the fatherless finds mercy."
[14:4] "I will heal their waywardness. I will love them freely; For my anger is turned away from him.
[14:5] I will be like the dew to Israel. He will blossom like the lily, And send down his roots like Lebanon.
[14:6] His branches will spread, And his beauty will be like the olive tree, And his fragrance like Lebanon.
[14:7] Men will dwell in his shade. They will revive like the grain, And blossom like the vine. Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.
[14:8] Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? I answer, and will take care of him. I am like a green fir tree; From me your fruit is found."
[14:9] Who is wise, that he may understand these things? Who is prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of Yahweh are right, And the righteous walk in them; But the rebellious stumble in them.

[15:1] &gt; Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?
[15:2] He who walks blamelessly does what is right, And speaks truth in his heart;
[15:3] He who doesn't slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his friend, Nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
[15:4] In whose eyes a vile man is despised, But who honors those who fear Yahweh; He who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn't change;
[15:5] He who doesn't lend out his money for usury, Nor take a bribe against the innocent.  He who does these things shall never be shaken.

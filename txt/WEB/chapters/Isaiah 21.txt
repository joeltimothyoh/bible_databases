[21:1] The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.
[21:2] A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; besiege, Media; all the sighing of it have I made to cease.
[21:3] Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold on me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I can't hear; I am dismayed so that I can't see.
[21:4] My heart flutters, horror has frightened me; the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.
[21:5] They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, you princes, anoint the shield.
[21:6] For thus has the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he sees:
[21:7] and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with much heed.
[21:8] He cried as a lion: Lord, I stand continually on the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;
[21:9] and, behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. He answered, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.
[21:10] You my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you.
[21:11] The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
[21:12] The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again."
[21:13] The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.
[21:14] To him who was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.
[21:15] For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.
[21:16] For thus has the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;
[21:17] and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.

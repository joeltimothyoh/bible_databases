[17:1] Better is a dry morsel with quietness, Than a house full of feasting with strife.
[17:2] A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, And shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.
[17:3] The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, But Yahweh tests the hearts.
[17:4] An evil-doer heeds wicked lips. A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.
[17:5] Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.
[17:6] Children's children are the crown of old men; The glory of children are their parents.
[17:7] Arrogant speech isn't fitting for a fool, Much less do lying lips fit a prince.
[17:8] A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; Wherever he turns, he prospers.
[17:9] He who covers an offense promotes love; But he who repeats a matter separates best friends.
[17:10] A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding Than a hundred lashes into a fool.
[17:11] An evil man seeks only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
[17:12] Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly.
[17:13] Whoever rewards evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house.
[17:14] The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, Therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.
[17:15] He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.
[17:16] Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he has no understanding?
[17:17] A friend loves at all times; And a brother is born for adversity.
[17:18] A man void of understanding strikes hands, And becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.
[17:19] He who loves disobedience loves strife. One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.
[17:20] One who has a perverse heart doesn't find prosperity, And one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.
[17:21] He who becomes the father of a fool grieves. The father of a fool has no joy.
[17:22] A cheerful heart makes good medicine, But a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
[17:23] A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, To pervert the ways of justice.
[17:24] Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding, But the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.
[17:25] A foolish son brings grief to his father, And bitterness to her who bore him.
[17:26] Also to punish the righteous is not good, Nor to flog officials for their integrity.
[17:27] He who spares his words has knowledge. He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.
[17:28] Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise. When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.

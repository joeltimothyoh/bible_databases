[22:1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
[22:2] "Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.
[22:3] Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?
[22:4] Is it for your piety that he reproves you, That he enters with you into judgment?
[22:5] Isn't your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.
[22:6] For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, And stripped the naked of their clothing.
[22:7] You haven't given water to the weary to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry.
[22:8] But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it.
[22:9] You have sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
[22:10] Therefore snares are round about you. Sudden fear troubles you,
[22:11] Or darkness, so that you can not see, And floods of waters cover you.
[22:12] "Isn't God in the heights of heaven? See the height of the stars, how high they are!
[22:13] You say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?
[22:14] Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn't see. He walks on the vault of the sky.'
[22:15] Will you keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden,
[22:16] Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
[22:17] Who said to God, 'Depart from us;' And, 'What can the Almighty do for us?'
[22:18] Yet he filled their houses with good things, But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
[22:19] The righteous see it, and are glad; The innocent ridicule them,
[22:20] Saying, 'Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, The fire has consumed the remnant of them.'
[22:21] "Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace. Thereby good shall come to you.
[22:22] Please receive instruction from his mouth, And lay up his words in your heart.
[22:23] If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, If you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.
[22:24] Lay your treasure in the dust, The gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.
[22:25] The Almighty will be your treasure, Precious silver to you.
[22:26] For then shall you delight yourself in the Almighty, And shall lift up your face to God.
[22:27] You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You shall pay your vows.
[22:28] You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you. Light shall shine on your ways.
[22:29] When they cast down, you shall say, 'be lifted up.' He will save the humble person.
[22:30] He will even deliver him who is not innocent; Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."

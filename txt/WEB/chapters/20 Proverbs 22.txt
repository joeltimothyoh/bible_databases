[22:1] A good name is more desirable than great riches, And loving favor is better than silver and gold.
[22:2] The rich and the poor have this in common: Yahweh is the maker of them all.
[22:3] A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
[22:4] The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh Is wealth, honor, and life.
[22:5] Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked: Whoever guards his soul stays from them.
[22:6] Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it.
[22:7] The rich rule over the poor. The borrower is servant to the lender.
[22:8] He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, And the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
[22:9] He who has a generous eye will be blessed; For he shares his food with the poor.
[22:10] Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; Yes, quarrels and insults will stop.
[22:11] He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully Is the king's friend.
[22:12] The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge; But he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.
[22:13] The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets!"
[22:14] The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit: He who is under Yahweh's wrath will fall into it.
[22:15] Folly is bound up in the heart of a child: The rod of discipline drives it far from him.
[22:16] Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, Both come to poverty.
[22:17] Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching.
[22:18] For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, If all of them are ready on your lips.
[22:19] That your trust may be in Yahweh, I teach you today, even you.
[22:20] Haven't I written to you thirty excellent things Of counsel and knowledge,
[22:21] To teach you truth, reliable words, To give sound answers to the ones who sent you?
[22:22] Don't exploit the poor, because he is poor; And don't crush the needy in court;
[22:23] For Yahweh will plead their case, And plunder the life of those who plunder them.
[22:24] Don't befriend a hot-tempered man, And don't associate with one who harbors anger:
[22:25] Lest you learn his ways, And ensnare your soul.
[22:26] Don't you be one of those who strike hands, Of those who are collateral for debts.
[22:27] If you don't have means to pay, Why should he take away your bed from under you?
[22:28] Don't move the ancient boundary stone, Which your fathers have set up.
[22:29] Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve kings; He won't serve obscure men.

[12:1] Then Job answered,
[12:2] "No doubt, but you are the people, And wisdom shall die with you.
[12:3] But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: Yes, who doesn't know such things as these?
[12:4] I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke.
[12:5] In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune, It is ready for them whose foot slips.
[12:6] The tents of robbers prosper, Those who provoke God are secure; Who carry their God in their hands.
[12:7] "But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; The birds of the sky, and they shall tell you.
[12:8] Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you; The fish of the sea shall declare to you.
[12:9] Who doesn't know that in all these, The hand of Yahweh has done this,
[12:10] In whose hand is the life of every living thing, The breath of all mankind?
[12:11] Doesn't the ear try words, Even as the palate tastes its food?
[12:12] With aged men is wisdom, In length of days understanding.
[12:13] "With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding.
[12:14] Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be built again; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
[12:15] Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up; Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.
[12:16] With him is strength and wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are his.
[12:17] He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools.
[12:18] He loosens the bond of kings, He binds their loins with a belt.
[12:19] He leads priests away stripped, And overthrows the mighty.
[12:20] He removes the speech of those who are trusted, And takes away the understanding of the elders.
[12:21] He pours contempt on princes, And loosens the belt of the strong.
[12:22] He uncovers deep things out of darkness, And brings out to light the shadow of death.
[12:23] He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.
[12:24] He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, And causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
[12:25] They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.

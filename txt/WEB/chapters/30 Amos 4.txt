[4:11] "I have overthrown some of you, As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire; Yet you haven't returned to me," says Yahweh.
[4:12] "Therefore thus will I do to you, Israel; Because I will do this to you, Prepare to meet your God, Israel.

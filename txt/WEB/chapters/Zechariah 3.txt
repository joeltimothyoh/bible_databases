[3:1] He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
[3:2] Yahweh said to Satan, "Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn't this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?"
[3:3] Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
[3:4] He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, "Take the filthy garments off of him." To him he said, "Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing."
[3:5] I said, "Let them set a clean turban on his head." So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.
[3:6] The angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,
[3:7] "Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.
[3:8] Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch.
[3:9] For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving of it,' says Yahweh of Hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
[3:10] In that day,' says Yahweh of hosts, 'you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.'"

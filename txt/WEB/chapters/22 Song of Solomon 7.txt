[7:1] How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince's daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skillful workman.
[7:2] Your body is like a round goblet, No mixed wine is wanting. Your waist is like a heap of wheat, Set about with lilies.
[7:3] Your two breasts are like two fawns, That are twins of a roe.
[7:4] Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
[7:5] Your head on you is like Carmel, The hair of your head like purple; The king is held captive in its tresses.
[7:6] How beautiful and how pleasant are you, Love, for delights!
[7:7] This, your stature, is like a palm tree, Your breasts like its fruit.
[7:8] I said, "I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of its fruit." Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, The smell of your breath like apples,  Beloved
[7:9] Your mouth like the best wine, That goes down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
[7:10] I am my beloved's. His desire is toward me.
[7:11] Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.
[7:12] Let's go early up to the vineyards. Let's see whether the vine has budded, Its blossom is open, And the pomegranates are in flower. There I will give you my love.
[7:13] The mandrakes give forth fragrance. At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have stored up for you, my beloved.

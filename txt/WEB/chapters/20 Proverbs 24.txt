[24:1] Don't be envious of evil men; Neither desire to be with them:
[24:2] For their hearts plot violence, And their lips talk about mischief.
[24:3] Through wisdom a house is built; By understanding it is established;
[24:4] By knowledge the rooms are filled With all rare and beautiful treasure.
[24:5] A wise man has great power; And a knowledgeable man increases strength;
[24:6] For by wise guidance you wage your war; And victory is in many advisors.
[24:7] Wisdom is too high for a fool: He doesn't open his mouth in the gate.
[24:8] One who plots to do evil Will be called a schemer.
[24:9] The schemes of folly are sin. The mocker is detested by men.
[24:10] If you falter in the time of trouble, Your strength is small.
[24:11] Rescue those who are being led away to death! Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!
[24:12] If you say, "Behold, we didn't know this;" Doesn't he who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, doesn't he know it? Shall he not render to every man according to his work?
[24:13] My son, eat honey, for it is good; The droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:
[24:14] So you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; If you have found it, then there will be a reward, Your hope will not be cut off.
[24:15] Don't lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. Don't destroy his resting-place:
[24:16] For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again; But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
[24:17] Don't rejoice when your enemy falls. Don't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;
[24:18] Lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, And he turn away his wrath from him.
[24:19] Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; Neither be envious of the wicked:
[24:20] For there will be no reward to the evil man; And the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.
[24:21] My son, fear Yahweh and the king. Don't join those who are rebellious:
[24:22] For their calamity will rise suddenly; The destruction from them both--who knows?
[24:23] These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good.
[24:24] He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;" Peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him--
[24:25] But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, And a rich blessing will come on them.
[24:26] An honest answer Is like a kiss on the lips.
[24:27] Prepare your work outside, And get your fields ready. Afterwards, build your house.
[24:28] Don't be a witness against your neighbor without cause. Don't deceive with your lips.
[24:29] Don't say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work."
[24:30] I went by the field of the sluggard, By the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
[24:31] Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. Its surface was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down.
[24:32] Then I saw, and considered well. I saw, and received instruction:
[24:33] A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep;
[24:34] So shall your poverty come as a robber, And your want as an armed man.

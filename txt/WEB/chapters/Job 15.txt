[15:1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
[15:2] "Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?
[15:3] Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches with which he can do no good?
[15:4] Yes, you do away with fear, And hinder devotion before God.
[15:5] For your iniquity teaches your mouth, And you choose the language of the crafty.
[15:6] Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; Yes, your own lips testify against you.
[15:7] "Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?
[15:8] Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
[15:9] What do you know, that we don't know? What do you understand, which is not in us?
[15:10] With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much elder than your father.
[15:11] Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word that is gentle toward you?
[15:12] Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,
[15:13] That you turn your spirit against God, And let such words go out of your mouth?
[15:14] What is man, that he should be clean? He who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
[15:15] Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones; Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight:
[15:16] How much less one who is abominable and corrupt, A man who drinks iniquity like water!
[15:17] "I will show you, listen to me; That which I have seen I will declare:
[15:18] (Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hidden it;
[15:19] To whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):
[15:20] The wicked man travails with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
[15:21] A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.
[15:22] He doesn't believe that he shall return out of darkness, He is waited for by the sword.
[15:23] He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
[15:24] Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
[15:25] Because he has stretched out his hand against God, And behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;
[15:26] He runs at him with a stiff neck, With the thick shields of his bucklers;
[15:27] Because he has covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat on his loins.
[15:28] He has lived in desolate cities, In houses which no one inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps.
[15:29] He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.
[15:30] He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, By the breath of God's mouth shall he go away.
[15:31] Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; For emptiness shall be his reward.
[15:32] It shall be accomplished before his time. His branch shall not be green.
[15:33] He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive tree.
[15:34] For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
[15:35] They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit."

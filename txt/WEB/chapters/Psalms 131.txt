[131:1] &gt; Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty, nor my eyes lofty; Nor do I concern myself with great matters, Or things too wonderful for me.
[131:2] Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
[131:3] Israel, hope in Yahweh, From this time forth and forevermore.

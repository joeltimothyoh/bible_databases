[133:1] &gt; See how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to live together in unity!
[133:2] It is like the precious oil on the head, That ran down on the beard, Even Aaron's beard; That came down on the edge of his robes;
[133:3] Like the dew of Hermon, That comes down on the hills of Zion: For there Yahweh gives the blessing, Even life forevermore.

[125:1] &gt; Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, Which can't be moved, but remains forever.
[125:2] As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore.
[125:3] For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment of the righteous; So that the righteous won't use their hands to do evil.
[125:4] Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, To those who are upright in their hearts.
[125:5] But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.

[77:1] &gt; My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, And for him to listen to me.
[77:2] In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.
[77:3] I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.
[77:4] You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can't speak.
[77:5] I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.
[77:6] I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; My spirit diligently inquires:
[77:7] "Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?
[77:8] Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?
[77:9] Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?" Selah.
[77:10] Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: The years of the right hand of the Most High."
[77:11] I will remember Yah's deeds; For I will remember your wonders of old.
[77:12] I will also meditate on all your work, And consider your doings.
[77:13] Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?
[77:14] You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.
[77:15] You have redeemed your people with your arm, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
[77:16] The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.
[77:17] The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.
[77:18] The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.
[77:19] Your way was through the sea; Your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.
[77:20] You led your people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

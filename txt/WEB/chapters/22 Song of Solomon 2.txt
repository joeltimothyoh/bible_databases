[2:1] I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.
[2:2] As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.  Beloved
[2:3] As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, His fruit was sweet to my taste.
[2:4] He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love.
[2:5] Strengthen me with raisins, Refresh me with apples; For I am faint with love.
[2:6] His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me.
[2:7] I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes, or by the hinds of the field, That you not stir up, nor awaken love, Until it so desires.
[2:8] The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, Leaping on the mountains, Skipping on the hills.
[2:9] My beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice.
[2:10] My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
[2:11] For, behold, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone.
[2:12] The flowers appear on the earth; The time of the singing has come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.
[2:13] The fig tree ripens her green figs. The vines are in blossom; They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, And come away.  Lover
[2:14] My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of the mountainside, Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
[2:15] Catch for us the foxes, The little foxes that spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.  Beloved
[2:16] My beloved is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies.
[2:17] Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, And be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.

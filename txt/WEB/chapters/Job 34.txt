[34:1] Moreover Elihu answered,
[34:2] "Hear my words, you wise men; Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
[34:3] For the ear tries words, As the palate tastes food.
[34:4] Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.
[34:5] For Job has said, 'I am righteous, God has taken away my right:
[34:6] Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.'
[34:7] What man is like Job, Who drinks scorn like water,
[34:8] Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men?
[34:9] For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.'
[34:10] "Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, From the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
[34:11] For the work of a man will he render to him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.
[34:12] Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
[34:13] Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who has appointed him over the whole world?
[34:14] If he set his heart on himself, If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath;
[34:15] All flesh would perish together, And man would turn again to dust.
[34:16] "If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words.
[34:17] Shall even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?--
[34:18] Who says to a king, 'Vile!' Or to nobles, 'Wicked!'
[34:19] Who doesn't respect the persons of princes, Nor regards the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.
[34:20] In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, The mighty are taken away without hand.
[34:21] "For his eyes are on the ways of a man, He sees all his goings.
[34:22] There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
[34:23] For he doesn't need to consider a man further, That he should go before God in judgment.
[34:24] He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And sets others in their place.
[34:25] Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
[34:26] He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others;
[34:27] Because they turned aside from following him, And wouldn't have regard in any of his ways:
[34:28] So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, He heard the cry of the afflicted.
[34:29] When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether to a nation, or to a man:
[34:30] That the godless man may not reign, That there be no one to ensnare the people.
[34:31] "For has any said to God, 'I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.
[34:32] Teach me that which I don't see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?
[34:33] Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know.
[34:34] Men of understanding will tell me, Yes, every wise man who hears me:
[34:35] 'Job speaks without knowledge, His words are without wisdom.'
[34:36] I wish that Job were tried to the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.
[34:37] For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God."

[9:1] An oracle. The word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach, And will rest upon Damascus; For the eye of man And of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh;
[9:2] And Hamath, also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
[9:3] Tyre built herself a stronghold, And heaped up silver like the dust, And fine gold like the mire of the streets.
[9:4] Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, And he will strike her power in the sea; And she will be devoured with fire.
[9:5] Ashkelon will see it, and fear; Gaza also, and will writhe in agony; As will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed; And the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
[9:6] Foriegners will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
[9:7] I will take away his blood out of his mouth, And his abominations from between his teeth; And he also will be a remnant for our God; And he will be as a chieftain in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite.
[9:8] I will encamp around my house against the army, That none pass through or return; And no oppressor will pass through them any more: For now I have seen with my eyes.
[9:9] Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! Shout, daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king comes to you! He is righteous, and having salvation; Lowly, and riding on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
[9:10] I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem; And the battle bow will be cut off; And he will speak peace to the nations: And his dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.
[9:11] As for you also, Because of the blood of your covenant, I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.
[9:12] Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope! Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.
[9:13] For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me. I have filled the bow with Ephraim; And I will stir up your sons, Zion, Against your sons, Greece, And will make you like the sword of a mighty man.
[9:14] Yahweh will be seen over them; And his arrow will go flash like lightning; And the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet, And will go with whirlwinds of the south.
[9:15] Yahweh of Hosts will defend them; And they will destroy and overcome with sling-stones; And they will drink, and roar as through wine; And they will be filled like bowls, Like the corners of the altar.
[9:16] Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; For they are like the jewels of a crown, Lifted on high over his land.
[9:17] For how great is his goodness, And how great is his beauty! Grain will make the young men flourish, And new wine the virgins.
